"As the number of Wi-Fi networks rapidly explodes, detecting, managing, and maintaining your Wi-Fi can become problematic"
"When everyone around you is blasting their own Wi-Fi signals—particularly in large business complexes with lots of other large companies—you’re more likely to experience problems with Wi-Fi signals dropping out, poor connectivity, and slow performance"
"Within your own Wi-Fi network, several optimizations could help ensure your network is functioning appropriately, including router placement, appropriate channel, and security measures"
"And of course, analyzing and understanding your wireless network is key"
"It includes high-performance network monitoring and insights and troubleshooting features, including Wi-Fi scanning and analysis capabilities, to ensure your network starts working again as soon as possible after a problem arises"
"The Wi-Fi analyzer then examines the spectrum to view networks, their channels, and signal strength"
"In simple terms, a Wi-Fi analyzer or scanner gathers information about access points and channels on your network and displays it in an easy-to-understand, visually accessible way"
"A wireless network analyzer can help you maintain connection quality, which can be vital for numerous business needs and performance metrics"
"Wi-Fi signals are constantly changing, and small changes in the network can have massive effects on the overall connection uptime"
"Using a Wi-Fi network analyzer for consistent Wi-Fi scanning helps you collect data and identify problems and indicate potential solutions, such as switching to another channel to reduce congestion"
You can also use Wi-Fi scanning software to discover areas in your facility with a weak Wi-Fi signal
"Scanning for wireless network devices enables you to view critical insights into your wireless network and devices, so you can troubleshoot and optimize your overall Wi-Fi performance"
"By gathering data like signal strength, coverage area, bandwidth trends, and more, a wireless network scanner can enable you to monitor and understand the activity happening across your Wi-Fi networks"
"Wi-Fi scanners and analyzers are built to display wireless network activity through topology maps, performance metrics, data correlation, and more Wi-Fi analysis capabilities"
"By locating all devices in your network and gathering their information, a Wi-Fi scanning tool can help you detect problematic devices along with other wireless network issues"
One example of this is troubleshooting a slow wireless network
"Having lots of connected devices can negatively impact your wireless network—when you scan for devices using a Wi-Fi Analyzer or scanner, you can see how many devices are on your network and what those devices are"
This can help you determine which devices should stay and which should get booted off the network to improve Wi-Fi speeds and reliability
"Along with detecting and deterring slow network speeds, a Wi-Fi scanner or analyzer can also help you protect your wireless network"
"Rogue attackers can crack open encryption, and wireless devices in secured buildings can be compromised by signal leakages"
Having lots of devices attached to your network can also put individual devices at risk
"By knowing where your signals are, which devices are connected, and what neighboring devices or networks exist, you can keep track of authorized and unauthorized users and devices to keep your network safer"
"This kind of software is usually easy-to-use and can provide great benefits in terms of connection reliability, signal strength, and download speeds"
"Despite its extensive list of features, it remains simple for both beginner and advanced users"
"NetSpot has a beautiful, easy-to-use interface, and is suitable for both beginners and experienced network administrators"
It uses two different modes: discovery mode and survey mode
"The first mode looks at a snapshot of the Wi-Fi networks near you, while survey mode can provide more detailed heat maps of Wi-Fi strength"
NetSpot is easy to install and includes several other visual representations of the wireless spectrum and the data it can collect
"There are four different versions: free, home, commercial, and enterprise"
"The difference between them is the number of zones you can look at, how many access points you can scan, and the number of data points you can collect with a scan"
Another product to consider is InSSIDer
This established Wi-Fi analyzer tool for Windows is very reliable
"The InSSIDer tool is generally intended for enterprise and business use, rather than for home users"
"Despite being geared toward admins, it’s still relatively easy to use"
"It gathers the data you would expect: channel, signal strength, MAC addresses, and encryption type for each access point on the network"
InSSIDer then provides you with a “link score” for each connection
"The higher the score, the better"
"The software is easy to install, with comprehensive guides and links to free webinars if you need more assistance"
Consider NetCut if you’re looking for a solution for professional or enterprise use
"It was originally created to be a back-end solution, but it can be used by anyone for network investigating and debugging"
NetCut allows you to monitor LAN activity and can display all the IP and MAC addresses and data of devices that are connected or have ever connected to your network
"With NetCut, you can kick someone off your network or restore their access at will"
"The main issue with NetCut for beginner users is that it has a lot of machine-translated documentation that may be hard to understand for someone who is not a network administrator, and a slightly more complex interface"
"NetCut includes an extra layer of protection called NetCut Defender, which protects your computer from ARP and MAC address spoofing"
"Unlike NetSpot and NetCut, WiFi Analyzer is intended primarily for home or temporary use"
"It comes in basic and pro versions, and the basic version includes everything you need to analyze your Wi-Fi network"
"The app takes your network and turns the data into easy-to-understand visualizations, suggesting which channel you should use to reduce congestion"
"For someone new to Wi-Fi analyzer tools, this would be a potential choice"
"For enterprise needs or larger networks, it’s probably much too limited"
"Like most other Wi-Fi analyzers, Vistumbler scans nearby networks for access points and can map your Wi-Fi network and connectivity strength while showing you detailed information about each network"
"It provides network status, MAC address, SSID, signal strength, channel number, and network type"
"Vistumbler is set apart by its GPS support, which can integrate with Google Earth to display Wi-Fi networks"
"This feature is for people who may be driving, walking, or cycling around to try to find Wi-Fi networks to use"
"When Vistumbler discovers a Wi-Fi network with this feature, the app can show you where the network is on a map and other network information"
"The main downside is that Vistumbler is not easy to use, and the user interface can be difficult to navigate"
"Again, it’s not a full enterprise solution for Wi-Fi analysis"
"With good-looking graphics and sophisticated UI, WiFi Commander is one of the more attractive Wi-Fi analyzer tools"
The WiFi Commander app shows Wi-Fi signal strength and displays it in real-time so you can use the most recent data to join the strongest or most stable Wi-Fi network
"If you need a free or open-source Wi-Fi analyzer tool, check out Wireshark"
"Its purpose is to analyze and troubleshoot different communications protocols, and it includes the ability to look at Wi-Fi"
"Wireshark is very complicated to use, and you’ll need some training to use it"
"As such, it’s normally only used by networking and Wi-Fi professionals"
"In addition, there are obvious disadvantages for relying on open-source tools for business use, so you may want something with a bit more built-up functionality"
It’s much more robust than some of the limited-scope tools I mentioned above
"Even so, I find the SolarWinds platform both intuitive and efficient"
"However, if you have no formal training or certification, it can be challenging to land a new job or achieve an internal promotion"
"Whether you work primarily with SQL or Oracle, you can use a prestigious certificate to increase your earning potential"
"In this guide, we’ll explore what to look for in a DBA certification"
We’ll also look at the best options for different databases
Not all database certifications are made equal
"As such, there are a few factors to consider when choosing the right one for you"
"Some qualifications cover several databases, which can help if you work with multiple systems"
You may like to consider the cost of the database certification
Some courses and certificates may cost several thousand dollars
"Therefore, you might want to consider if the investment is worthwhile for your career as a DBA"
We’ve already explored the importance of a database certification and how to choose the ideal one for you
"With those factors in mind, let’s look at four of the best options for different databases"
It’s a dual qualification built to demonstrate your proficiency in both SQL and Microsoft Azure databases
"Although the exam has an administrative fee, you can complete the training courses for free on the Microsoft website"
"As such, you can easily ensure you have mastery of the necessary skills"
"If you pass the assessment, you’ll receive an online certificate you can save and share with your new or potential employers"
You’ll also get a Microsoft Certified badge you can add to social networks such as LinkedIn or your resume
This is a higher-level certificate that builds upon the basics offered in entry-level Oracle certifications
"Therefore, it could be suitable for experienced DBAs looking to jump to a senior administrative role"
You’ll need to pass at least one advanced administration course from the Oracle University platform
"These modules can either be remote or in-class, but don’t offer self-taught alternatives"
"Then, you’ll take the final exam to gain the certification"
"If you pass the exam, you’ll earn the relevant badge"
"You can display it online, such as in your resume or professional networks"
"Additionally, you’ll be able to print out a certificate recognizing your credentials"
"As such, getting qualified in DBA for PostgreSQL could open up multiple employment opportunities with sizable businesses"
"Therefore, you’ll learn how to manage the database type without influence from particular companies"
"Unlike some other certifications, the CPSDBA has a strict timeline"
You’ll need to complete all courses in four days and then receive the qualification
"As such, you may need to take some time off work to achieve this certificate"
"Therefore, you’ll likely need to work with it at some point in your DBA career"
"As such, gaining a MySQL database qualification can improve your skills and open doors to new positions"
You can complete free training via the Oracle University platform
"However, you’ll likely need some practical experience from your role as a DBA to master the concepts"
"Then, you’ll take the exam online"
The certificate comes with an online badge you can display across your social media and professional profiles
Database certification can demonstrate your skills as a proficient database administrator (DBA)
"Furthermore, a prestigious certificate could increase your job prospects or land you an internal promotion"
"The best remote support tool is secure, user-friendly, and provides five-star customer support"
"IT professionals seeking software for their organization should consider pricing and licensing restrictions, and compatibility with their existing infrastructure and compliance with industry regulations"
"As remote work continues to rise, we expect to see the use of remote support programs expand beyond IT help desks and customer support teams"
"Remote support software and remote desktop tools share the same basic idea, but they’re quite different in their purposes"
"When using remote desktop software, only the host can view and interact with the target device’s screen"
This means the end user of the remote device isn’t involved in the activity occurring during the remote desktop process
There is little to no collaboration during a remote desktop session—it’s mostly a means for IT staff to remotely maintain an organization’s software and hardware
"On the other hand, remote support programs are made to facilitate communication between the end user and the host user"
"When using a remote assistance tool, both parties have the ability to see the remote device’s screen and interact with it freely"
This means many remote assist programs are also built to leverage features that support a productive and collaborative remote support session
Remote desktop software is often used to handle customer service for this reason
"There are many benefits to using remote assist programs like Remote It support software and Windows remote support, such as increased customer satisfaction and improved training for IT administrators"
SaaS remote support programs are known to offer complete flexibility since you can access remote devices from literally anywhere through SaaS remote assist programs
"Web-based remote support software is also usually easier to set up, more intuitive to use, and requires less IT knowledge to configure"
"On-premises remote support software must be accessed on the specific host device, limiting the accessibility of remote support capabilities"
"However, because these remote support programs live on a single device or group of devices, security can be increased"
"Also, on-premises solutions are highly customizable and can be designed to handle unique, industry-specific configuration challenges"
"Using a remote assistance tool like Dameware, which is built to simplify Windows remote support administration operations, can help you stay organized and decrease the likelihood of a safety emergency"
"Before diving into this list, there were a few criteria I used to evaluate the remote support programs"
"An IT or network admin should consider these specs before choosing their own remote support solution, depending on their network’s unique needs"
"As remote support solutions become more prevalent, users will be less tech-savvy than the original clients (IT professionals)"
We wanted tools that were easy to use and easy to understand
Remote support desktop software should be simple to navigate and provide fast customer support
We assess tools for connection speed and for how efficiently the process was to connect to a remote client machine (without having to navigate complex settings)
E-commerce sites and healthcare organizations are two examples of businesses that need to meet a high bar as far as protecting customer data
Remote support software should have the ability to offer two-factor authentication and HIPAA compliance
"Because remote work can lead to employees working in different environments and time zones, we looked for tools with assistance on email, live chat, phone, Twitter, and more"
"With these questions in mind, these are the best remote desktop software tools we selected for this year"
"For IT administrators, Dameware is built to make life easy"
"No matter where the IT issue occurs, a network administrator can initiate a secure remote connection with computers inside the LAN"
"Use remote access to start and stop services and process, copy, or delete files, review and clear event logs, and more"
Built-in remote system tools and TCP utilities can help administrators troubleshoot specific issues without having to log into a full remote session
"If you provide managed services for your customers or clients, you’ll need a solution that enables you to assist them as quickly and effectively as possible"
"In this scenario, Take Control is our recommended pick"
"Zoho Assist is designed for small businesses, and it’s the useful remote desktop for SMBs who are cost-conscious"
Zoho Assist has two main products: Remote Support and Unattended Remote Access
"Remote Support gives small businesses the capability to provide instant, on-demand support sessions to their customers"
"File transfer, instant chat, remote print, and session scheduling are all built into the remote support software"
"We think it’s a great all-on-one tool for those needing the ability to support their customers through on-demand, web-based remote support sessions"
We also found that it’s relatively easy to set up
"Larger enterprises with teams located all over the world will like TeamViewer, a remote support software that combines remote access and shared meeting tools in one app"
"We believe while the costs associated with using TeamViewer might be prohibitively high for some companies, the wide variety of technical capabilities available on this tool make it worthy of inclusion on this list"
We think there are a lot of bells and whistles built into TeamViewer—which is why it’s a tool best suited for large corporations—but the interface is reasonably user friendly to navigate
"Built into this remote computer access solution are features like wake-on-LAN, which gives users the ability to wake up a sleeping computer and put it back to sleep when finished"
"Plus: file transfer capabilities, cross-platform access, iOS screen sharing, secure unattended access, and more"
"If you’re seeking a basic, low-cost remote support software, we feel Splashtop is an easy pick"
We found it to be a basic remote computer access software that does the trick
"Many users deploy Splashtop to stream video and audio with minimal latency issues, or for using applications, transferring personal files, and managing desktop programs remotely"
"We believe the security settings are incredibly straightforward, giving users the choice to either enter the account credentials used on the remote machine with an additional code that specified by the user, or to enter a specific access code for the remote machine"
"Private users can even skip that step and remote in sans password, a nice feature for personal use on an at-home or small business network"
We think the interface of Splashtop is relatively basic
"So, while you won’t find fancy features, we feel the low-cost and easy security settings make it a good choice for anyone seeking a low-cost solution for personal use"
RemotePC is designed for always-on remote access that can be set up once by sharing a unique access ID and key
"We found this process to be quick, and generally reduces the time spent verifying devices; because RemotePC is available across multiple platforms and devices, end-users can conveniently chat between computers and drag and drop file transfers"
Unlimited concurrent access makes RemotePC competitive against some of the other picks that charge fees for more than one user utilizing the software at once
"Customer service and support options include video tutorials, customer support via phone, live chat, FAQs, and a blog with resources and tips"
LogMeIn is our first runner-up for all-around best remote desktop software
"Three different options—Pro, Central, and Rescue—give enterprises the choice of which features and budget are right for them"
"Pro and Central are the remote access software tools, while Rescue is geared toward providing traditional remote support"
We also found there’s a lot of customer support available through their community forum and knowledge base
"Even if you’re an IT professional, you could be forgiven for not having the Microsoft Azure environment on your radar"
"However, this lack of familiarity means you could be missing out on the Azure platform’s powerful features"
"In this article, we’ll introduce you to Azure cloud computing"
"Then, we’ll walk you through three reasons why it could matter for your organization"
Customers with access to Azure technology can use it for tasks like executing program analytics and storing essential data
These features make the Microsoft Azure infrastructure an extremely useful tool if you’re looking to develop new applications or run existing ones
"It’s also geared towards IT professionals, meaning you’ll gain access to all the advanced settings you need"
An Azure environment helps you break away from on-premises servers
Physical servers can be expensive to maintain
They’re also vulnerable to data loss from hardware malfunctions
"However, the cloud-based system means you can harness the power of Microsoft technology without limitations"
"Here are a few reasons why this wildly popular technology might matter enough to make you a paying customer, too"
"Whether it’s a far-away natural disaster or a technical glitch in your own office, it’s important to prepare for the worst"
The integrated recovery tools of Microsoft Azure technology can help you do just that
One reason for this is an on-premises data center
"This program may rely on the cloud, but it’s not its only resource"
"You can use the Azure web service to store emergency backups in locally redundant storage (LRS), geo-redundant storage (GRS), and zone-redundant storage (ZRS)"
"For more peace of mind, you can also automate your backup policy"
No need to keep yourself on a schedule—regular maintenance is part and parcel of the Microsoft Azure infrastructure
"Azure cloud computing will alert you of any radical changes to your metrics, which are easily trackable with the help of an intuitive dashboard, like in SolarWinds SAM"
The Microsoft Azure infrastructure can produce almost any type of web application
"However, it’s not just about the creation process: it can also meet your hosting needs"
This kind of flexibility means you don’t have to worry about weighing the “Azure IaaS vs
It can perform equally well no matter which environment you choose
Virtual machines (VMs) are also well-served by the Microsoft Azure platform
Microsoft leverages the full power of its cloud servers regardless of your choice
The Microsoft Azure environment can provide in-depth monitoring to show exactly how your applications are performing
"As we mentioned earlier, the cloud-based Microsoft Azure infrastructure gives you almost limitless storage options"
You can keep any data you need for an Azure cloud computing project securely at your fingertips
You don’t always know exactly how much storage you’ll need
"For example, comparing the fine data needs of an Azure IaaS vs"
PaaS project could take a lot of time and may influence your choice
"Without the limits of a physical server, you can make sure you’re only paying for what you need"
"Whatever you need the data storage for, Microsoft will also be keeping it safe"
Its Microsoft Azure environment is fully in line with the company’s strict standards and compliance rules
"In addition to the disaster recovery features, it’s both a powerful and safe solution"
The multi-monitor display and screen-sharing capabilities also make this a great tool for remote teams looking to work together collaboratively
"Inevitably, it’s worthwhile to start vetting the best remote support software sooner rather than later to prepare for the rise of remote work outside of IT help desks"
"Network intelligence might sound a little scary, like an artificial intelligence computer gone rogue, but the reality is less terrifying"
"As networks get more complex, organizations choose and deploy more complicated network technologies, products, and services"
"This allows people and businesses to perform more technical, high-power tasks, but it can also potentially open networks to threats"
"To combat that risk, admins leverage network intelligence"
Using network intelligence tools can help your company improve its services and ensure your networks are secure
"When the information is put together, it can reveal relationships and serve as “intelligence” about the network"
"The analysis of these data packets includes checking whether the data is in the correct, expected format, whether there’s any malicious code or unexpected data in each packet, and whether there are any unusual spikes or changes in traffic"
"For example, a business can use network intelligence to see how their customers or users engage with their service or product, segment customers into different groups for A/B testing or target particular customers for specialized services"
This allows the business network to be optimized and prevent unnecessary delays caused by network slowdowns
"Network intelligence tools collect information about who’s accessing a network, the method they used, the time of access, and the location (in terms of both IP and geography)"
"If an attacker accesses a network, network intelligence tools can flag this unusual behavior to a network administrator, who can then take steps to prevent the network from being infiltrated or damaged"
"Furthermore, as businesses increasingly use cloud-based applications and storage, having clear baseline measurements for how the network performs is important for preventing third-party data leaks or issues"
"Network intelligence can provide real-time awareness of how a network is performing, with alerts and a clear data trail if a cybersecurity issue occurs"
The tool draws on packet metadata to help you understand network traffic type (and risk level)
"You can understand response time for applications, and easily see whether slowdowns are caused by applications or the network"
And it does all that with easy-to-use charts and graphs
"Alternatively, high-priority or critical alerts can be set to appear at any time, with all relevant information included in the alert, so you can troubleshoot your network quickly when it counts"
Network intelligence tools can help ensure appropriate alerts are set up to flag any issues and your business quality of service continues to improve
Establishing a well-documented software change management plan helps minimize disruption and improve the efficiency of changes in general
"If the change doesn’t go as planned or if something interrupts the change before it can be fully implemented, it’s critical to have a rollback plan to ensure the change doesn’t interfere with standard business operations"
"If something goes awry, then having the option to restore data from a backup can significantly simplify recovery efforts"
"Testing plans are likewise necessary, helping improve the likelihood of successful change implementations by identifying potential risks, helping teams develop plans for how to mitigate their effects, and following up after the fact to confirm the change was carried out correctly"
Change monitoring is critical to ensuring your systems—and business—stay operational
"Server Configuration Monitor (SCM) is an application built for the working IT professional in today’s fast-paced digital world, offering a robust toolset of monitoring capabilities and features for detecting and comparing configuration changes"
"SCM can also help correlate changes with performance metrics on a common timeline, helping establish clearer lines of cause and effect between configuration changes and related performance issues affecting your systems"
SCM uses agent-based monitoring to track configurations for your Windows and Linux devices and applications
The tool also includes an intelligent alerting system designed to keep you in the know when application and system configurations stray from their baselines and may affect software performance
Monitoring these changes in real time can allow you to quickly counteract performance bottlenecks caused by hardware and application configuration changes as soon as they’re noticed
SCM allows IT departments to plan and implement configuration changes with greater efficiency and lower risk
"Using SCM, you can more easily measure the impact of planned changes in the configurations of your computing environment and react immediately to unexpected changes in performance"
SolarWinds Server Configuration Monitor (SCM) includes features designed to streamline the process of tracking and comparing configuration changes for all monitored nodes across your environment
"The Recent Configuration Changes widget, as the name suggests, highlights the latest updates from within the Server Configuration Summary dashboard, giving you easy visibility into the most recent configurations"
"The widget will display configuration changes enacted within the specified time window, including useful information like the profile name, the node where the change occurred, and the name or path for each element affected"
"The widget also uses color-coded indicators beside each entry to provide a quick visual cue for the sort and general frequency of changes taking place (yellow for additions, blue for updates, red for removals)"
The dashboard is also designed for efficiency and easy reference—clicking on individual entries within the widget will bring up the two most recent versions of the device configuration
"Not only that, but SCM makes it easy to compare configurations between two points in time, highlighting how the configurations differ in two side-by-side panels for clear, quick insights about each monitored node, grouped by element type and profile for easy reference"
Any changes to permissions and other files attributes are likewise highlighted to prevent seemingly insignificant changes leading to bigger setbacks downstream
"The Content Comparison page in the application allows you to drill down further, with a line comparison feature for the content of all monitored elements at the two specified time points"
Unchanged lines between configurations are automatically collapsed by default—saving you the trouble of sorting through multiple lines to get to the changes you’d like to examine—but can be expanded with a click if your analysis needs to be more granular
"When you want to transfer a file to someone else, there are several different approaches you can take"
"The best approach will depend on how big the files are, as some systems and services have size limits"
There are also specialized tools to compress a file to make it much smaller when you need to send it
"Not only does this allow you to send large files by email, but some compression software also includes other useful features such as file encryption or locking with a password"
It can be used on any computer for business or organization use
These cloud-based file-sharing services can free up space on your hard drive and allow you the flexibility of making one-off transfers
"If you have a really large number of large files you need to transfer, sometimes the fastest way can be physically couriering the data"
You can buy a large hard drive and have it sent to someone else with all the data on the drive
"Of course, this has obvious disadvantages, but in some special cases, it’s the best option"
"File transfer tools are also useful, and as they’re purpose-built for sharing files, they usually upload and download much faster than cloud storage services"
Serv-U FTP is a great FTP server software for teams of all sizes
"It allows you to safely and easily transfer multiple or large files over FTP and FTPS (that is, FTP over SSL/TLS), from mobile devices, as well as a web platform"
You can view all file transfers in the transfer queue to check their progress and allocate resources such as bandwidth to help files transfer faster
"You can also put limits on how much bandwidth is used at critical times, to ensure file transfers don’t throttle the rest of the network"
"It’s built for use across a business, with the features to match"
Another option to consider is Citrix ShareFile
"Even though Citrix is known for their networking and cloud services, they also provide numerous different SaaS products"
ShareFile can also scan for dangerous content and is generally very easy to use and navigate
"ShareFile offers four separate plans: standard, advanced, premium, or a virtual data room plan"
"For each of these, you can also try a free trial and thereafter pay a monthly fee"
Read my review of what I consider the best file monitoring software available today
IIS performance monitoring allows you to proactively measure and collect metrics and log data related to web server performance
"With real-time insights, you can troubleshoot current issues or make changes to optimize future performance"
"For instance, you could use a tool to automatically track response time metrics"
A slowdown in your IIS server response time means it will take longer for users to access your websites and web applications
"If they’re forced to wait too long, those users will likely either send a help desk ticket or leave the site"
"With insight into response time, you may be able to remediate the issue before end users feel the impact"
You could also use log data for insight into IIS servers
You can track anomalies that could signal security breaches or vulnerabilities
"After all, if the security of your IIS server is compromised, it could have even more serious consequences for your business than a simple reduction in performance"
"Given how central the server is to the successful functioning of your critical applications, the effects of a security compromise could be devastating"
"SAM also enables you to monitor response time, site and application pool performance, key server and website resources, and more to maintain high availability throughout your network"
"SAM is also built to display in-depth details of your IIS web server, which can help you spot issues and troubleshoot them before end-users are negatively affected"
"Proactive, threshold-based SAM notifications could alert you of server or website downtime and perform automatic counter-actions"
You can also view details about configuration changes across IIS servers and web files with SAM
"Along with IIS monitoring, SAM can enable you to monitor logs with the Real-Time Event Log Viewer"
This built-in tool is designed to filter and monitor real-time events using a component monitor and lets you pause or restart polling
"Event logs can be viewed in real-time on SAM and filtered by log type, event source, and severity level"
"AppOptics collects and monitors the metrics you need to keep your IIS server performing effectively, offering insights to help you pinpoint the root causes behind performance issues"
"The tool can gather data on the server’s CPU, memory, network, disk, and more"
"With the addition of a traffic plugin, the tool can also collect information about requests, connections, memory, and network statistics for your application pools and websites"
"If the included metrics don’t cover your needs, you can create your own custom or composite metrics"
"The IIS performance monitor also comes with an intelligent alerting system to inform you whenever a threshold is exceeded, so you can proactively monitor the first signs of trouble"
"It aggregates, monitors, and analyzes all your IIS logs in one place"
"With all your logs collected together, it’s much easier to search through them if an issue arises"
Its clear and simple interface lets you discover patterns and trends in the data you can use to make educated decisions about optimization
"You can also easily search through error and access logs using the advanced filtering and searching tools in Papertrail, which let you search by date, time, user ID, IP address, and more"
Papertrail provides access to both historic and current log files
"By filtering event streams in real time, you can direct your attention to the most important entries, accelerating your troubleshooting process"
Exclusion searches can also help you filter out unwanted distractions
"At the same time, you can turn saved searches into alerts, so you get notified when an unexpected event happens"
Or you can use inactivity alerts to stay informed about when expected events don’t happen
"This can help you keep track of the health and performance of your IIS server, compare statistics over time, and spot trends"
"Applications Manager is also designed to notify you of irregular IIS metrics, so you can detect issues as soon as they arise"
You can enable ManageEngine Applications Manager to monitor current load on websites by capturing bytes and files transferred per second
"Access connection statistics through Applications Manager, such as the number of current connections or individual web transactions"
This information can help you estimate how many anonymous users are on your websites and narrow down related issues with your IIS server
It’s built to help specialists manage their server logs and turn those logs into useful data points
"While it comes with the support of an online community, the tool lacks the user-friendly interface and customer support of a paid solution"
"LOGalyze uses the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) method to allow multiple network devices, servers, and applications to feed event logs and syslogs into the tool"
"From there, you can monitor the data as it’s collected"
LOGalyze includes an analyzer engine with correlated event detection and real-time insights
You can set up alerts for events matching your assigned criteria
You can also use the LOGalyze web interface to run and export dynamic reports for regulatory compliance
This tool is focused on providing real-time performance insights through color-coded network graphs
"Depending on your needs, the interface can display data for small LAN installations or large networks with thousands of devices"
"As with most open-source tools, using Cacti to monitor your IIS servers requires some specialized knowledge to ensure you set up appropriate IIS performance counters for both your server and web applications"
Cacti requires a webserver that supports PHP—both IIS and Apache are appropriate choices
"You will also need MySQL, RRDTool, and net-snmp"
"Cacti integrates with devices using SNMP, while RRDTool provides Cacti’s graphing functionality"
"Loggly visualizes, organizes, parses, and indexes your IIS logs"

"As such, it’s important for developers and IT managers to implement reliable Java performance monitoring practices if they wish to maintain high performance standards for their organization’s critical web applications"
"To accomplish this goal, it’s important to monitor the right elements and choose the right tools for effective Java performance tuning"
Here’s a list of our most recommended Java performance monitoring and optimization tools
This real-time information helps developers optimize their troubleshooting practices for any Java application
Users can also collect performance metrics and in-depth transaction traces with the aid of built-in features for other different coding frameworks and libraries like
AppOptics’ Java performance monitor has an intuitive user interface that comes with open integrations for Snap and Telegraf ecosystems
"Users can also add custom and pre-configured plug-ins or create their own, allowing for increased flexibility when monitoring Java web apps"
"With SAM, you get the tools you need to more easily identify and act on performance-related issues affecting Java applications"
"With SAM, real-time alerts let you troubleshoot issues before they escalate into larger problems"
"Using custom and built-in alerts, which can be configured to report issues across important metrics, developers can be notified about problems in production"
"With the option to run pre-made reports or create customized reports, SAM allows you to seamlessly run necessary reports to help you sustain Java monitoring best practices"
"SAM evaluates critical Java application server metrics across memory, application, concurrency, and database"
"Memory metrics include garbage collections, memory heap size, heap used, and non-heap used"
Application data such as compiler time and runtime uptime is also available with SAM
"Concurrency metrics are tabulated according to blocked time, blocked count, threads started count, wait time, and wait count"
"Database metrics, meanwhile, account for classes loaded, unloaded, and total loaded count"
SAM also can effectively detect any web service APIs that may be adversely affecting Java applications
"SAM’s Java web app performance monitoring tool helps you monitor and understand SOAP/JSON protocols, latency, and availability, and validate the returned content"
"Using out-of-the-box HTTP/HTTPS component monitors, SAM provides a complete picture regarding the health of JSON services operating across your servers"
"The HTTP/HTTPS user experience monitors mean you can monitor, POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE methods being run"
"With Loggly, developers can consolidate logs from their different web applications and analyze them alongside infrastructure or network logs, all on the same UI"
"Loggly hosts all log data on a single dashboard, which comes with pre-configured charts and graphs to add detail to your Java logging overview"
"For example, Loggly helps enable users to parse partial and multi-line stack traces automatically, making it easy to search for specific logs across all Java web applications"
"With better querying capabilities, users can more quickly turn silos of raw Java data into actionable information"
One of the most important metrics to monitor on a Java-based system is memory—by keeping tabs on your Java heap usage
"Essentially, all Java objects are stored in an area called the heap"
"When an application runs, the heap’s storage will fluctuate in size"
"If the heap becomes full, objects are discarded to make room"
"But if your heap isn’t running smoothly, you risk having bottlenecks in your web applications"
The Eclipse Memory Analyzer is a full-stack Java heap analyzer specifically designed to help developers allocate memory consumption and set policies
"Developers can use the Memory Analyzer tool to analyze heap dumps, even when millions of objects are passing through"
They can also calculate the retained sizes of objects to help ensure the garbage collector is collecting the right objects from the heap
IT teams can also generate ad hoc reports to extract leak suspects
Web tracing is an important practice for IT teams who want to record and analyze information about a web application’s performance
"But manual tracing can be tedious—developers have to inspect hundreds of packets, identify the protocols being used, and track down hundreds of IP addresses to gain a holistic understanding of how a Java-based web application is faring"
LightStep is a full-service trace viewer able to make things a bit easier by automating parts of the above process
Security Event Manager (SEM) comes highly recommended as a near-automated IT security compliance solution that enables you to verify IT compliance and helps you perform many compliance-related IT operations
"IT compliance and security both contribute to the protection of a company’s digital assets, but they operate differently"
"While effective IT security involves establishing and implementing technical controls to safeguard a company’s assets, IT compliance—sometimes called IT security compliance or technology compliance—involves meeting the regulatory or contractual requirements defined by a third party"
"Third-party IT compliance regulations your company is required to comply with might come in the form of government policies, industry regulations, security frameworks, or contractual terms associated with the service or product you are providing"
"Because third parties often determine IT compliance standards, certain regulations might sometimes seem like they go beyond what your company considers to be strictly necessary"
"However, failure to comply with information security compliance standards can have a severe impact on your business"
"Given the seriousness of IT and technology compliance, you must be aware of any information security compliance standards applicable to your business"
"Whether your company is subject to compliance requirements will depend on several factors, including the country or state it operates in"
"Areas with privacy or data laws, like the California Consumer Privacy Act and GDPR, are likely to have compliance standards you must follow"
"Heavily regulated markets, like finance and healthcare, typically require businesses to meet certain standards"
You may also have to adhere to specific regulations if you are working with clients who require high levels of confidentiality
"In this case, your client contract or non-disclosure agreement (NDA) may define the compliance standards you’re expected to meet"
"Your company’s ability to comply with the terms of your client contract, for example, might be less about security and more about safeguarding service availability and reliability"
IT compliance should always form part of a robust and comprehensive IT security strategy
Companies required to comply with certain standards will incur costs associated with creating the necessary systems and policies to achieve full IT compliance—but there are some notable benefits to meeting information security compliance standards
Here are a few of the most significant advantages of IT and technology compliance
"In many cases, bad actors steal personal customer information clients have entrusted the business with"
"In the aftermath of a data breach, a company must face the difficult task of earning back its customers’ trust"
"Sometimes, the damage done is irreparable"
A great benefit of complying with IT and technology compliance regulations is the safety it affords your company’s reputation
Companies must be aware of any existing compliance regulations that apply to them to avoid penalties and fines
"In some cases, these penalties can be severe and unsustainable"
Detailed below are the fines associated with some of the most well-known IT compliance acts and regulations
Avoiding these hefty fines is a significant benefit of IT compliance
Organizations that fail to invest in their IT compliance and regularly fall short of the required standards are significantly less likely to be considered for valuable business partnerships
"If failure to comply with the necessary standards resulted in hefty fines, or damaged reputation, this could have a knock-on effect on any associated partners"
"As a result, most businesses are understandably hesitant to establish partnerships with organizations that have failed to achieve IT compliance"
Achieving IT compliance can open the door to valuable business partnerships
Committing to IT security compliance can create several opportunities for companies to improve other aspects of their business
"By setting yourself security compliance goals, like those outlined below, you can increase the value and return on investment of your IT compliance efforts"
"IT compliance often requires companies to enhance their data management capabilities, which can reap operational benefits"
"For many companies, complying with data security regulations begins with effectively managing and storing sensitive customer information"
"This requires businesses to ensure they can access, modify, or delete information efficiently and reliably"
"By enhancing their data management capabilities to ensure IT compliance, companies can implement improved IT asset management policies for data monitoring, which can have a positive effect on operational efficiency"
"For example, many businesses choose to implement organizational tools to make stored customer data searchable"
"They can then segment the data, analyze it, and potentially reveal hidden marketing opportunities"
Companies that collect customer data have the chance to make improvements to their company’s attitude towards privacy by adopting robust IT compliance practices that may either meet or exceed requirements
"In doing so, organizations can establish an internal culture external brand identity that prioritizes data privacy and IT security"
"This positions their company as morally responsible, which is likely to attract both customers and high-quality talent"
Many companies choose to establish a security compliance goal of exceeding the expectations of information security compliance standards
This tells its workforce and its audience they view data security as a matter of trust and responsibility rather than a legal requirement—which could set it apart from other organizations
"With LightStep, developers can create custom system diagrams around services and tags, and share snapshots that collect and analyze thousands of related traces"
"Plus, LightStep can easily integrate into hundreds of projects or Java-based web applications"
Developers need to do more than just write functional code
"An organization might want to know other things, like general performance metrics, how much memory is being used by a web application, or how concurrent executions affect a network"
"As such, developers will utilize profilers to gain these insights"
"For Java-based code, it’s wise to use a Java profiler to monitor constructs and the JVM level"
"EJ Technologies’ JProfiler is a Java profiler tool that enables users to more quickly resolve performance bottlenecks, identify memory leaks, and obtain a better understanding of any threading issues"
"With JProfiler’s heap walker, developers can use a UI to view a set of objects from five different angles for better inspection"
This allows them to solve memory problems more efficiently
"When it comes to Java log management and analysis, many developers turn to the JMX console, which provides information about the health and resources of a JVM"
JMX monitoring relies on real-time querying to gain information from the MBeans (Managed Beans) within the JMX console
This is another process that must be automated to be performed efficiently
"Pingdom allows for a lightweight install, so there are no complicated configurations to get started"
"What’s more, users benefit from custom alerts that help flag potential Java issues"
"Sematext Experience is designed to diagnose anomalies and provide alerts in real-time, so your webpage and web app can always be firing on all cylinders"
"With key insights, Sematext Experience allows you to enhance front-end performance"
Real user monitoring differs from Sematext synthetic monitoring capabilities because it inspects page-level specifics and individual user sessions
"Sematext Experience also connects Business Operations and Development Operations teams, providing real-time metrics to manage and further the customer experience"
It sends alerts in real-time when it detects a bug that may adversely affect user satisfaction or performance
"It can track HTTP requests, page loads, UI interactions, and resources, too"
One of the tool’s main purposes is to identify slow-loading pages
The full resource waterfall shows the assets slowing down pages at any given time and includes a comprehensive load time analysis
"You can inspect and analyze resources, including JavaScript files, stylesheets, fonts, and images, according to associated load times"
"User activity monitoring means every page-load event becomes captured and displayed within visualized charts, providing you greater insight into the time spent in the browser and on the back end"
"This software also helps you dig deeper into filterable data across browser type, URL, version, geolocation, and operating system"
Real user measurement drives support for single-page applications since you can keep monitoring the resource usage and page performance of your single-page applications
"Sematext Experience also is designed to monitor Apdex Scores, so you can sustain high user satisfaction"
"In real time, you can detect performance bottlenecks by assessing the page load speeds of your web app or website"
Another core function of Sematext Experience tool is its ability to map out business journeys in real time
This enables you to retract real user journeys from beginning to end—providing you a view into where and why users might have encountered performance-related issues like slow page loads or errors
"Sematext Experience serves as a one-stop-shop for you to combine and harness the power of logs, metrics, and real user monitoring under one centralized and visual roof"
Real-time data analysis helps you to proactively troubleshoot performance issues and diagnose their potential business impact
"To maximize the value of their IT compliance efforts, many companies make leveraging data insights effectively a security compliance goal"
"When companies implement security applications and tools to meet information security compliance standards, they regularly gain important insights into their operational efficiency"
"For example, they might discover poor management of personnel, inefficient use of resources, or other assets that could be redeployed"
Companies may also uncover opportunities to reduce operational costs or improve their marketing efforts
Committing to leveraging data insights appropriately as part of your IT compliance efforts is an important security compliance goal and can make IT compliance feel less like a burden and more like a critical internal function
"By delivering this data in real-time, you can uncover and rapidly respond to issues, including policy violations, threats, and attacks"
"Built-in reporting templates can help ensure your IT compliance reporting efforts are streamlined, consistent, and reliable"
"Ideally, the compliance reports tool you choose should include built-in report templates for external and internal regulatory compliance standards relevant to your company"
"To certify the tool you are considering is suited to your company’s compliance requirements, keep an eye out for templates that support the regulatory compliance standards you must comply with, such as PCI DSS, SOX, HIPAA, or GLBA"
"While automated reporting can be beneficial, there may be times when your company could benefit from on-demand reporting"
"On-demand, custom reporting enables you to generate reports that address issues at specific times"
This can be especially helpful when troubleshooting
A combination of automated and on-demand reporting options affords you the best of both worlds
This helps you discover and respond to compliance violations quickly and efficiently
One of the more sophisticated capabilities to look out for is automated compliance violation response
"Many security issues will require immediate action to minimize the damage, which is why choosing a tool designed to automatically act against compliance violations is of critical importance"
SolarWinds Security Event Manager is an affordable but sophisticated compliance reports tool designed to deliver near-automated compliance reporting
"This tool includes the key features you need, providing automated compliance violation response, the option of automated and on-demand reports, built-in templates, cross-event correlation, real-time log analysis, and much more"
The SEM compliance reporting application converts data collected by SEM into information you can use to identify and troubleshoot network issues
"SEM allows you to run reports on your database to gain insight into trends and events, enabling you to make informed choices regarding network activity"
"Once you have run your report, you have the option of printing or exporting it to different formats, including Microsoft Word and PDF"
"For IT administrators, network congestion is a looming possibility, with money and time on the line if your network is running slowly"
"Because network congestion is a common problem with many potential origins, your IT team needs a network congestion solution to identify slow traffic and get your network running quickly"
"Before you can decide on the best solution for your network, here’s what you need to know"
"Network congestion occurs when your network is operating at a slower-than-normal speed, creating slow response times on your devices"
"Network congestion can also lead to difficulty accessing internet services, low-quality user experiences, and network timeouts"
"Network congestion is affected by three main factors: bandwidth, throughput, and network latency"
Each of these terms describes the way data is transmitted to and from devices on your network
"When these measures of data transmission are underperforming, your network can become congested"
"Low bandwidth, low throughput, and high latency all lead to network congestion"
"At best, these issues can lead to slow device performance—and at worst, data loss or frozen screens"
An overactive network is one of the most intuitive ways congestion can occur
"When there are too many devices competing for bandwidth, data transmission will slow down to process all the data in your system"
Some networks are designed to run more efficiently than others
"Without an optimal network configuration, networks with a reasonable amount of activity can become congested"
Make sure your subnets aren’t too big and assign each device a role that optimizes the flow of traffic
"When overactive devices are running on your network, network throughput can decrease"
"Whenever a large amount of traffic is traveling through your network at the same time, data packets can get backed up on their routes"
Too much activity is caused by “bandwidth hogs”: devices that either communicate too much data or run too frequently
Not every instance of slow device performance means your network has been compromised
"However, it’s important to recognize a security breach is a potential cause of network congestion"
"If your network has experienced a security attack, event and firewall logs can help you figure out where it occurred"
"As long as there are networks, there will always be a certain degree of network congestion"
Network congestion management software offers a reliable way to minimize the amount of congestion and keep your network up and running
Network congestion solutions offer a way to pinpoint the origin of slow performance with an automated solution for a streamlined approach to network traffic management
Network congestion is one of the most critical problems to address as an IT administrator
"If you’re looking to manage network congestion for networks large or small, these services are your best bet"
"You can receive alerts when bandwidth is low, generate traffic reports, and perform QoS tests to ensure your devices are performing up to speed"
"Like the bandwidth analyzer pack, SolarWinds NTA offers network traffic monitoring with trend analytics available using the PerfStackfeature"
NTA is a great tool for monitoring network congestion and identifying low bandwidth before it affects end-user performance
"The PRTG Network Monitor provides a respected set of tools for network monitoring, which include real-time metrics to identify congestion fast"
Maybe the most unique feature of the PRTG Network Monitor is its ability to update network maps with real-time bandwidth metrics
"Once you’ve created a PRTG map of your network using the software’s map making tool, you can continuously monitor devices on your map in a visually intuitive way"
PRTG Network Monitor is compatible with the major operating systems
Auvik network congestion monitoring allows you to monitor your network traffic on the same platform as your asset management system
"You can link devices with auto-discovery, which allows you to receive real-time traffic reports from discoverable devices as soon as they’re up and running"
Troubleshooting is more of a manual task with Auvik than with other services—your team will still need to identify correlations based on your own event log analysis
"NetFlow Analyzer is helpful for network traffic monitoring, and you can use ManageEngine tools to effectively fix network congestion issues"
"A notable advantage of NetFlow Analyzer is its ability to shape traffic for applications only, so you can redirect traffic from congested areas and prevent the delivery of suspicious packets"
"In addition to traffic monitoring, NetFlow Analyzer helps you to generate user-friendly performance reports for effective troubleshooting"
"Even though it’s last on the list, WhatsUp Gold is still a complete network solution to network congestion with plenty of benefits"
WhatsUp Gold is especially useful for monitoring traffic from applications and monitoring on-premises Windows devices
"With alerting and report templates, you can identify and troubleshoot network performance bottlenecks with a user-friendly approach to network traffic management"
Network congestion isn’t just an annoyance—it can cause serious financial damage
"A slow network can cause costly downtime, unhappy customers, and lost data"
"Because network efficiency is so important for any company’s bottom line, reducing network congestion is one of the most important tasks in IT administration"
"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth, and system stability improved immediately"
WP Engine is one of the pioneers of the managed WordPress hosting industry
"However, the market for managed hosting solutions has evolved greatly bringing in plenty of different use cases and needs"
"We know that everyday WordPress and website users are looking for an alternative hosting solution to WP Engine that combines top performance, security, and higher quality support and we truly believe Kinsta provides all (and more) of these"

"In the rare event that something were to happen to your site, our security guarantee means you will get hands-on assistance from our engineers, free of charge"
We’ll restore your site and make sure it’s free of backdoors that hackers can take advantage of
"On WP Engine, you don’t have access to a secure firewall with DDoS protection unless you pay for an extra “Global Edge Security” add-on"
"Furthermore, WP Engine’s lack of uptime monitoring for non-premium and non-enterprise plans means you might not get notified promptly when your site goes down unless you pay for a third-party monitoring service"
"The Kinsta team is mostly made up of developers, which allows us to create a WordPress hosting solution tailored for developers, without sacrificing ease of use"
Everything from our custom dashboard to our products and tools is built to help improve your productivity
"With Kinsta as your hosting provider, you’ll have all the tools needed to manage your WordPress site, regardless of your technical knowledge"

"Lastly, with multi-user support in the MyKinsta dashboard, you’ll be able to provide permissioned dashboard access to agency developers or even directly to your clients"
"Furthermore, Kinsta customers have access to every data center location without any extra or hidden fees"
"In addition, certain locations like the popular Frankfurt data center in Germany require a plan with “upgraded pricing”"
"WordPress is a dynamic CMS, which means it’s constantly executing PHP code in the background"
"Depending on your theme and plugin configuration, it’s possible for your site to get bogged down with bloated and inefficient code"
"An APM tool monitors requests to your site and tracks various metrics like external API requests, database queries, PHP execution time, and more"
This information allows you to quickly debug and troubleshoot performance bottlenecks
Kinsta APM provides you with key WordPress performance insights without the need to pay for third-party subscriptions to other APM services
"Unlike Kinsta, WP Engine plans do not come with a free custom-built APM tool"
"This means if you’re on a lower-tier WP Engine plan, you won’t be able to collect insights about your site’s performance"
"WP Engine offers an APM tool powered by New Relic, though, only on premium and enterprise plans"
"As a managed WordPress hosting company, we understand the importance of a platform capable of supporting high-traffic, resource-intensive ecommerce sites"
We also recognize the unique and demanding challenges that come with powering online stores
This is why we optimized our platform for WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads
"Instead, they only make Google Cloud Platform’s fastest servers available for dedicated plans"
"For developers and agencies, Kinsta offers a simple to use (but powerful) local development tool called DevKinsta"
"With DevKinsta, you can launch WordPress sites with a full hosting stack and SSL support on your local computer (macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu) with just a few clicks"
WP Engine is compatible with the Local WordPress development tool
"However, WP Engine’s integration with Local doesn’t support WordPress multisite configurations which are very popular with agencies and developers"
"If you’re a busy freelance or agency developer, DevKinsta’s advanced features (including multisite support) and MyKinsta integration can be a huge time saver"
It should also be noted that Kinsta does not have a bandwidth cap like WP Engine does
"Furthermore, our “overage pricing” comes in at half that of WP Engine"
You won’t have to deal with any complex technology or risk losing critical data
Fabulous dashboard! With great stats for debugging and speed optimisation
"To get started, simply complete our site migration request form, and our experts will reach out to schedule a time"
Then you can track the migration’s status directly from your MyKinsta dashboard
"In addition to free bandwidth, all Kinsta plans include a free Content Delivery Network (CDN)"
Our content delivery architecture was tailor-made for high throughput and low latency
"This spans all major regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, and Africa"
Kinsta is constantly exceeding our clients’ expectations
"Our satisfied customers are eager to spread the word about our products and services, which has helped us become one of the fastest-growing hosts in the industry"
"To make the Kinsta affiliate experience even more enjoyable, we custom-built our own easy-to-use affiliate dashboard"
"Therefore, you won’t have to deal with complicated or confusing third-party platforms"
"Since WP Engine doesn’t pay recurring commissions for the lifetime of a referred customer, their affiliate program doesn’t allow you to build a passive income stream"
"If you’re looking for a value-packed, powerful, and more user-friendly alternative to WP Engine, Kinsta’s managed WordPress hosting solution has you covered"
Linux is an open-source operating system currently powering most of the Internet
There are hundreds of different versions of Linux
"For web servers, the two most popular versions are Ubuntu and CentOS"
Both are open-source and free community-supported operating systems
"CentOS (Community Enterprise Operating System) is a free, open-source Linux distribution"
It provided an enterprise-level computing platform freely available for anyone to use
A new version of CentOS has been released after each new RHEL distribution with a one-to-two-month lag as a downstream community project
"As it is secure and highly customizable, CentOS proved to be a robust platform used by many hosting and cloud providers"
"It continued the tradition started by Red Hat, providing an extremely stable and thoroughly tested operating system"
"Ubuntu is a free, open-source Linux distribution based on Debian"
Everything changed when Mark Shuttleworth founded Canonical and gathered a small group of Debian developers to create a user-friendly Linux desktop
"As a result, they introduced Ubuntu – an easy-to-use solution for the everyday user"
"Ubuntu is released in three editions (Desktop, Server, and Core) all of which can run on a standalone computer or in a virtual machine"
"Each version can be distributed or downloaded to a USB drive, which you can boot into without making permanent changes to your operating system"
A bootable drive allows you to take the system for a test run before installing it
"Now, take a look at how CentOS and Ubuntu differ according to the following criteria"
The system core is the main difference between these popular Linux distributions
"Unlike Ubuntu, CentOS does not have frequent updates due to the extensive testing on each component before release"
"New versions are developed and tested for extended periods, which is why some developers consider it to be more stable and secure"
"On the other hand, this implies the operating system may be running more mature software versions than Ubuntu would"
"Also, the slow release cycle means a lack of access to third-party software updates"
You may need to manually install third-party software or updates if they haven’t made it into the repository
Ubuntu allows you to maintain the latest software with its frequent updates
"Because of the frequent updates, Ubuntu often includes newer software into newer releases"
"That can be fun for playing with new options and technology, but it can also create conflicts with existing software and configurations"
"Both Linux distributions are considered secure and stable, but there are slight differences between them"
CentOS is less prone to cyber threats as it goes through three layers of security patches
"Also, it includes a number of corporate-level security updates, enhancing its stability even more"
"Like CentOS, it performs security patches well, however, it is more prone to web threats due to its frequent updates"
"When it comes to support, Ubuntu has the upper hand with its excellent documentation, extensive support community, and a myriad of tutorials"
CentOS doesn’t lag far behind and has good documentation and a smaller yet active support community
Major releases of CentOS are maintained for ten years
The Canonical team developed Ubuntu focused on creating an easy-to-use Linux
"Therefore, Ubuntu gets high marks for its user-friendliness when it comes to usability"
This straightforward distribution allows you to install a graphical user interface on a server for easier management
"The GUI is intuitive and easy to manage, with a handy search function"
Running utilities from the command line is straightforward
"Most commands will suggest the proper usage, and the sudo command is easy to use to resolve “Access denied” errors"
Ubuntu Linux offers a more seamless software installation process
Most commonly used software and operating system features are included and updated automatically
"Ubuntu is a better choice for less experienced users, whereas working on CentOS requires some technical skills and is typically for more advanced users"
"Still, CentOS does include certain tools to simplify working on the platform, such as the cPanel control"
"With CentOS built around the Red Hat architecture, many old-school Linux users find it more familiar and comfortable"
"Over the years, one distro proved to perform better in certain use cases and scenarios over the other"
CentOS is often used by system administrators who want to manage web hosting services with a control panel
"Ubuntu does not support cPanel, whereas CentOS offers compatibility with cPanel, Webmin, DirectAdmin, and other management panels"
It’s been mostly implemented in high-end corporate IT applications
"Additionally, medium and larger-sized businesses opt for this operating system instead of other Linux distributions as it is a mature, stable platform with good documentation"
CentOS releases updates much slower than other Linux variants
"If you have a strong business need for stability or your environment is not tolerant of change, this can be more helpful than a faster release schedule"
"Ubuntu is most commonly used by less experienced system admins, users who appreciate a GUI or run smaller private servers"
"Although it doesn’t support cPanel, it has alternatives such as VestCP and Webmin to simplify web hosting management"
"Most of the best gaming distros are Debian/Ubuntu-based, so it is a popular choice for game servers"
"If you are a beginner or like implementing new software and technology as it’s released, you might lean towards Ubuntu"
CentOS might be a better fit if you’re a seasoned pro or hate dealing with updates breaking your server

"To do so, you should contact the state or national data protection or labor authority in the jurisdiction where you work"
Both web and application servers respond to user requests for content
"Yet, there are several key differences between the two server types, and knowing these distinctions can help you configure the right software and hardware infrastructure for your needs"
"A web server is a computer system that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to clients"
The client is almost always a web browser or a mobile application
"Depending on the setup, a web server can store one or more websites"
"Traditionally, web servers do not deal with dynamic content or server-side programming"
Web servers accept and fulfill Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) requests only
"Optionally, you can add components for dealing with dynamic content"
An application server is a software framework that delivers content and assets for a client application
"Clients include web-based applications, browsers, and mobile apps"
"When web browsers became the main application clients, the line between app and web servers got blurry"
"Most web servers have plugins for scripting languages (ASP, JSP, PHP, Perl, etc"
"For example, if we add a"
"NET plugin to an IIS environment, we can connect the web server to server-side code and serve clients with dynamic content"
There is an overlap on the app server’s side too
Many application servers offer web server capabilities and use HTTP as a primary protocol
"Because of the overlap in use cases and technology, most popular servers are hybrids of the two types"
A hybrid solution that combines server capabilities ensures optimal system speed and functionality
"Nginx is event-driven, highly scalable, and can process multiple requests at the same time"
Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services) is a free web server software package for Windows Server
IIS only runs on Windows operating systems
"While primarily a web server, Jetty can also facilitate machine-to-machine communication"
LiteSpeed is a web server with excellent performance and scalability properties
LiteSpeed offers a wide range of features and has an easy-to-use web admin console
Apache Tomcat is an open-source app server often used in conjunction with Apache HTTPD
"Tomcat can execute Java Servlets, deliver pages with JavaServer Page code, and serve Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition) apps"
WebLogic is fully integrated with Oracle’s product and cloud service portfolio
Glassfish is an open-source Java EE application server that supports Java Servlets and Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)
Glassfish can also function as a web server
"JBoss application server is an open-source platform for building, deploying, and hosting Java applications"
"JBoss operates across platforms, and you can use it on any operating system that supports Java"
Another option is to use plugins to add functionalities to a web server
"In that case, a web server can delegate dynamic response generation to a server-side technology option, such as CGI scripts, JSPs, Servlets, ASPs (Active Server Pages), or server-side JavaScript"
A popular setup is to deploy both a web server and an application server in the same system
This setup makes sense for websites that provide both static and dynamic content
"In that case, the web server becomes a subset of the application server, and both services run on the same hardware"
The main reason for deploying both types of servers is improved system performance
"Each server focuses on its strong points, and you prevent simple web requests from impacting application server performance"
"As an example, consider an e-store that provides real-time pricing information"
Such sites typically have a form with which a user can purchase products
"When the user submits a query, the website does a lookup and returns the results set within an HTML page"
This functionality can operate with and without an application server
The application server stores the business logic for the pricing lookup
"The web server delegates the response generation, but the script calls the application server’s lookup service and then formulates an HTML response"
"By placing the pricing logic in the app server, the logic becomes reusable between different parts of the application"
"In our first scenario, the pricing lookup service is not reusable as data is embedded in an HTML page"
The overlap between application and web servers means that each use case has several valid solutions
"Most systems can operate with a web server, app server, or a combination of the two"
"However, not all setups are equally good"
"Knowing the differences between the two server types helps you save money, scale more easily, and choose a better fit for your use case"
"Businesses typically have a lot of resource waste, and many decision-makers opt to use a cost management tool to prevent this unnecessary overhead"
We showcase the pros and cons of each platform to help you identify the right option for your business
GCP Billing is a solid option for companies that use Google Cloud and require a high-level overview of costs and saving opportunities across whole cloud infrastructures
"For businesses with larger projects and teams, GCP Billing falls short due to a lack of granularity and advanced capabilities"

CloudAdmin offers real-time visibility into cloud resources and helps companies optimize both single and multi-cloud environments
The tool also has a robust notification system
You can set CloudAdmin up to constantly monitor for better pricing options and set up custom alerts that notify you when the team runs into unnecessary spending
CloudAdmin is an excellent cost optimization tool for any company that relies on a public cloud regardless of industry
"Like GCP Billing, AWS CE is a good starting point for a company operating at a small cloud scale"
"As the team grows, using AWS CE as the single source of truth becomes an operational struggle"
AWS CE is an ideal option if a business using AWS needs a high-level overview of all cloud costs to understand their bill and plan future budgets
Apptio Cloudability is a well-rounded cloud cost optimization platform that provides more usage transparency than most other solutions
The tool is an excellent choice for FinOps and finance teams due to various integration options with ITFM (IT Financial Management) tools
"Developers also have instant feedback on how deployment, scaling, and cluster changes impact cloud consumption"
CloudCheckr offers strong support for reservation portfolio management
The platform provides actionable advice on how to adjust existing reservations to maximize coverage and minimize waste
The tool also has a utilization heatmap and visualization panel that help identify usage patterns and plan scheduled shutdowns
"Due to the interconnection between cost optimization and security, CloudCheckr is a good choice for companies using the cloud in high-risk industries that wish to keep the number of management tools low"
"Like GCP Billing and AWS CE, Azure Cost Management is a built-in tool available to the users of the Microsoft Azure cloud"
The platform helps customers understand their cloud bills and offers a high-level overview of Azure spending
"Azure Cost Management offers many integrations, so users can customize their platform and get more control over cloud usage than with other built-in tools"
"For example, an integration with PowerBI allows better and more detailed reporting"
This tool is ideal for smaller companies with a simple cost structure that require a high-level overview of AWS costs and saving opportunities
This tool has a robust rightsizing engine that provides a highly configurable policy for defining an efficiency target
CloudHealth also excels in reservation purchase and portfolio management for AWS
CloudHealth is an excellent choice for companies wishing to optimize their cloud costs while minimizing the number of vendors in their management strategy
Spot is a cloud cost management tool that helps companies automate their cloud cost optimizations based on data
"Unlike some more traditional competitors, Spot does not stop at discovering saving opportunities"
The platform uses automation to implement the recommendations instead of tasking the team to make necessary changes
Spot is an ideal fit for engineering teams who know how to make the most out of the tool’s automation features
The tool helps reduce spend and prevent resource-based outages
Kubecost focuses on identifying costs and optimization possibilities in Kubernetes
"Densify helps customers manage VMware, cloud, and container infrastructure while ensuring high levels of performance"
This tool allows you to take control of cost and performance through machine-learning recommendations and automation
"Densify helps save money with valuable advice, risk identification, and robust reporting capabilities"
The tool analyzes CPU/Memory usage and ensures that applications use appropriate instance types
"This platform is a good option for single cloud, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments"
Flexera is highly programmable and provides a proprietary policy language for extending the product’s functionality
This capability allows businesses to potentially support more cloud services than what the platform offers by default
"Due to the focus on hybrid clouds, this platform has excellent parity among different cloud platforms"
"Flexera is the only current vendor that scores “High” for AWS, Azure, and GCP support"
"Xi Beam emphasizes user-friendliness and simplicity, so acting upon most recommendations is a one-click procedure"
The tool also simplifies cost governance and multi-cloud management by providing unified visibility into public and private clouds
"Teams can set Xi Beam up to automatically create cloud consumption reports by various users, departments, apps, stake or budget owners, etc"
Turbonomic achieves continuous cost optimization by matching app demand to supply
This tool can be set up both as a packaged software or as SaaS
The platform’s integration with ParkMyCloud provides one of the most advanced resource scheduling on the market
Resource scheduling and automation capabilities are the main focuses of Turbonomic
"While the tool somewhat neglects other functionalities, the two core features are among the best in the business"
"If you decide to use Turbonomic, adopt additional tools to address your cloud cost management requirements"
Determine how much money you can allocate for the new platform and evaluate whether a flat fee or the pay-as-you-go model is the better option
"Most companies offer packages in different price ranges, so be careful to not overspend on features you do not need"
A good strategy is to start small and invest more if the tool performs well after a few months
Most cloud cost optimization tools offer trial periods
Trials allow you to test both the third-party team and the platform before signing up with anyone long-term
Developing an in-house cost optimization tool is not advisable due to the high complexity of such platforms
"Unless you are willing to dedicate resources and time to the project, partnering with a third-party vendor is a better business decision"

"It works as a postal address, ensuring that network traffic is sent to the correct computer"
There are a few different commands you can use to check your IP address
"To run these commands, start by opening a terminal window/command line"
The system will display your internal IP address
The entries will include one for a wired (Ethernet) adapter and a wireless (Wi-Fi) adapter
You may also have an entry for a virtual adapter
"Generally, only one entry will have an IP address listed – that is the one you will want"
"If you see that address listed, either you are looking at the wrong line, or you are not connected to the network"
This opens a new pop-up window with details on wired settings
"To find your public IP address, reach out to an external website"
Each computer in a network is required to have its own IP address
"If two systems have the same IP address, it will generate errors on the network"
Most modern networks will detect the problem and prompt you to fix it
"However, older networks might get confused, trying to route traffic to both computers"
Now you know how to find a private and public IP address in Linux using multiple methods

Get in touch with us and let’s see how we can help you meet your goals
A DDoS attack enables a hacker to flood a network or server with bogus traffic
"Too much traffic overloads resources and disrupts connectivity, stopping the system from processing genuine user requests"
"Services become unavailable, and the target company suffers prolonged downtime, lost revenue, and dissatisfied customers"
The practices we show below help minimize the impact of a DDoS and ensure a quick recovery from an attack attempt
"The sudden spike in messages, connection requests, or packets overwhelms the target's infrastructure and causes the system to slow down or crash"
"A botnet is a linked network of malware-infected computers, mobile devices, and IoT gadgets under the attacker's control"
"Hackers use these ""zombie"" devices to send excessive numbers of requests to a target website or server's IP address"
"Loss of business, abandoned shopping carts, frustrated users, and reputational harm are usual consequences of failing to prevent DDoS attacks"
"While all DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm a system with too much activity, hackers have different strategies they rely on to cause a distributed denial of service"
"The three approaches rely on different techniques, but a skilled hacker can employ all three strategies to overwhelm a single target"
"An application-layer attack targets and disrupts a specific app, not an entire network"
A hacker generates a high number of HTTP requests that exhaust the target server's ability to respond
Trying to prevent DDoS attacks of this type is challenging as security teams often struggle to distinguish between legitimate and malicious HTTP requests
"These attacks use fewer resources than other DDoS strategies, and some hackers can even use only a single device to orchestrate an application-layer attack"
"While an app-level DDoS targets a specific app, the goal of a protocol attack is to slow down the entire network"
"The attacker's traffic blocks legitimate users from accessing services, preventing traffic from flowing in or out"
All volumetric attacks rely on botnets
Hackers use armies of malware-infected devices to cause traffic spikes and use up all available bandwidth
Volumetric attacks are the most common type of DDoS
"As an attack only has an impact if a hacker has enough time to pile up requests, the ability to identify a DDoS early on is vital to controlling the blast radius"
Relying on multiple distributed servers makes it hard for a hacker to attack all servers at the same time
"If an attacker launches a successful DDoS on a single hosting device, other servers remain unaffected and take on extra traffic until the targeted system is back online"
"Since DDoS attacks work by overloading a server, a CDN can share the load equally across several distributed servers"
"If your security team can quickly identify the traits of a DDoS attack, you can take timely action and mitigate the damage"
"Therefore, detecting a low-volume attack is as vital as identifying a full-blown DDoS"
"That way, you do not need to wait for a security team member to pick up on the warning signs"
"Depending on a setup, the CM tool either contacts admins in case of an issue or follow response instructions from a pre-defined script"
A hacker behind a DDoS attack will likely send requests to every device on your network to amplify the impact
Your security team can counter this tactic by limiting network broadcasting between devices
"While using on-prem hardware and software to counter the DDoS threat is vital, cloud-based mitigation does not have the same capacity limitations"
Cloud-based protection can scale and handle even a major volumetric DDoS attack with ease
"That number indicates that nearly every business will face a DDoS at some point, so preparing for this attack type should be at the top of your security to-do list"

"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth, and system stability improved immediately"
"Kinsta has combined the fastest network and platform in the world (Google Cloud), and paired it with the best engineering team and the most experienced WordPress developers in the industry"
"Our MyKinsta dashboard was built from the ground up specifically for WordPress, making site management a breeze"
We truly believe we’ve made the highest quality WordPress hosting solution on the market
Today we're going to dive into how Kinsta sets itself apart and exactly what makes us different from other hosts you might have tried in the past
"We’ve found that most comparisons can typically be broken down into three categories: cPanel hosts, unmanaged server providers, and managed WordPress hosting providers"
"So let's explore how Kinsta is different, specifically, features and services that are unique to our platform"
"These include the largest hosts in the industry such as EIG companies like Bluehost and HostGator as well as providers like Siteground, GoDaddy, and InMotion Hosting"
"The average customer using a shared cPanel hosting plan usually only pays a few dollars per month, and at some point will most likely experience slowness or poor support"
Support is usually subpar due to the sheer volume of sites vs support representatives
Shared hosts have to spread themselves very thin to even make a profit and this usually leads to an unpleasant experience for the client
"It is almost a certainty that you'll see faster page load times, along with back-end (WordPress dashboard) speed when you host with Kinsta"
"Our hosting infrastructure is built on extremely powerful servers, meaning your sites will not be starved for CPU and RAM resources"
We utilize Google Cloud Platform and their data centers have extremely robust network connections
Independent reviews have shown Kinsta to be the fastest WordPress host on the market
You can switch to them at a click of a button
"MariaDB, a faster drop-in replacement for MySQL is also standard in our environment"
"And in regards to our web servers, we don't use Apache as Nginx is much faster"
"Another aspect of performance is caching, which is the process of storing resources from one request and reusing those resources for subsequent requests"
"In other words, caching will make your WordPress site load faster while doing less work"
"Usually, those with cPanel hosts will utilize a third-party caching plugin to implement this"
"At Kinsta, you don’t need to worry about messing with any complicated and confusing caching plugins, as this is done at the server-level"
"These limits can include all sorts of various server processes, such as the number of concurrent MySQL connections, CPU usage, and even total database size"
This allows us to provide WordPress-specific features and tools that you typically won’t find with a host that utilizes cPanel
Many of our features have come directly from client’s feedback
"We actively listen to all requests, and if something can help make everyone’s lives easier and more productive, you can count on us looking into it"
"We also have other premium features, such as easy to use backup systems, simple PHP switching and restarting, easy-to-use SFTP and SSH access"
"Some of the features might be available from cPanel hosts, but we can promise you they aren’t nearly as easy to find and use as they are at Kinsta"
"We monitor your sites every minute for uptime, proactively stop malicious code from entering our network, and offer free DDoS protection for all sites hosted on our infrastructure"
"In addition to our secure firewall powered by Cloudflare, we also implement tight software-based restrictions and malware scanning daemons that run continuously in the background to protect your WordPress site"
"Because of that, we typically do not recommend installing additional security plugins on your WordPress site"
"Kinsta also utilizes Cloudflare’s firewall, which means in some cases IP blocking features of some security plugins won’t work as intended"
This is actually an advantage for you
"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth, and system stability improved immediately"
Everything that we do is focused on building a solution that can scale while providing the level of service that our customers expect
Cloudflare solutions give us that scalability and free up our teams' time and energy to focus on proactive features and solutions
Director of Development Andras Gerencser and VP of Marketing Andrea Zoellner unpack the latest hosting industry trends and how their teams continue to meet customer needs and exceed expectations
"For automatic software updates and security patches, consider using a provider such as Kinsta which offers fully-managed WordPress solutions"
"If you want to host your business or blog, Kinsta's managed WordPress hosting is the best"
"Without any hesitation, Kinsta is incredible when it comes to uptime and speed"
"Kinsta made it extremely difficult for us to find any flaws in it, which is much more than just an achievement"
"If you factor in the quality of service it provides, then you may realize it is better to spend some extra money on the quality since it matters in the long term"
"It means you don’t need to worry or manage as many third-party plugins and you’ll see a boost in performance! If you need extra protection or help to decrease bot and or proxy traffic, our support team is also standing by in case you need to block an IP from accessing your site"
"Server-wise, cPanel hosts will let you drop as many sites as you wish into a single /public_html/ directory, here at Kinsta every site runs in an isolated Linux container, meaning that if one site is ever compromised the rest of your sites are still safely isolated from the affected site"
We also offer unlimited hack fixes for free
Our support team is also standing by in case you need to block an IP from accessing your site
When you need help you’re always talking to a knowledgeable support engineer fast
"With unmanaged hardware, you get an empty box and build whatever you need on top of it"
"With Kinsta, you get the same sort of server power but we’ve already built those features for you"
"For example, features such as automatic backups, staging sites, PHP version switching, server redirections, server-based page caching, a free Cloudflare integration, and a search-and-replace tool are already built-in and ready for you to use"
"Non-technical users can use Kinsta to easily create new sites, clone existing sites, create staging sites, and more"
"If you’re used to unmanaged hardware, then you’re used to having to reach out to your technical team do all of these sorts of things"
"With Kinsta, non-technical teams, such as marketing and sales teams, can do most tasks for themselves and only reach out to the technical teams when they need a developer"
"You don’t have to worry about updating server packages, installing new packages, hardening the server, and otherwise managing the infrastructure"
Kinsta handles the infrastructure so that you can focus on building your business
"While an unmanaged server provider may provide decent support, it will almost certainly not be WordPress-specific"
Typically these hosts are fine-tuned to work with WordPress and their support teams will be more knowledgeable when it comes to knowing their way around the CMS
"These providers can range from shared servers, to VPS, or even dedicated environments"
Massive performance improvements are particularly likely if the client has dozens of sites packed onto a single VPS or dedicated server at another managed WordPress hosting provider
"All data centers are available across all plans, and you can even choose a different data center of each of your sites"
"This is designed to minimize distance and hops, resulting in faster more secure global transport of your data"
"Beware, some hosting providers might opt for Google's ""standard tier"" network service without telling you to cut costs, but we believe in only utilizing the best here at Kinsta"
"This results in faster SFTP download and upload speeds, making file transfers quick and painless"
"Your back-end WordPress dashboard will also feel more snappy and responsive, especially when uploading files to the media library"
"Our hosting platform doesn't fall into any of the traditional hosting categories, and is very different from traditional shared, VPS, or dedicated infrastructure"
Kinsta utilizes LXD managed hosts and orchestrated LXC software containers for each site
"What this means is that every WordPress site is housed in its own isolated container, which has all of the software resources required to run it (Linux, Nginx, PHP, MySQL)"
We're also the only provider who uses this container-based infrastructure from our entry-level plans up through our top Enterprise plans
This means that a site can grow with Kinsta without ever having to go through major infrastructure migrations
Every site can also take advantage of our scalable infrastructure to better handle sudden surges in traffic and load
Hardware resources (CPU/RAM) are allocated to each site container automatically by our virtual machines on an as-needed basis
Our staff will then start resolving the issue well before you contact us

One support ticket and they’re already in the red
Most hosts offer their “unlimited resources” plan to make money
You have probably all seen this
Hosts will throttle the clients who use up a lot of the resources
"This, in turn, ends up with those angry clients leaving, making room for more clients that don’t use a lot of resources"
"In the end, you have a vicious cycle of the hosting company pushing cheap plans, signing up customers who they hope won’t use a lot of resources, and will purchase upsells"

Take advantage of more than a decade of experience the Kinsta team has fixing WordPress issues daily
Just because we separated people into three different groups above doesn’t mean it is always the right way to go
You should do your research to make the right choice for your business
Perhaps you start with the DIY method and upgrade to managed hosting after growing
"Or you could invest in managed hosting, to begin with, and focus all of your efforts on growing your business"
This is why our team is structured completely differently
"WPMU DEV reviewed Kinsta without us knowing, making a tremendous unbiased opinion"
Here is what Raelene thought of our support team
"If you go with a shared host or the DIY route, they will typically be on more barebone machines, and you will need to spend time installing software and optimizing to obtain the same speeds that a managed WordPress host offers out of the box"
"Or, in some cases, on a shared host, there won’t be anything you can do to achieve the speeds you need"
This alone can save you a lot of frustration as caching plugins are never fun to deal with
"And in most scenarios, server-level caching is much faster than any plugin"
This allows clients to start testing earlier and take advantage of free and instant performance gains
And here is an example of what happened when someone migrated away from Kinsta to shared hosting
"If we look at the HTTP header, we can see it is being served up from the Kinsta cache on a server-level, and there is no caching plugin running"
We then use virtual machines located in one of Google Cloud Platform’s multiple data centers worldwide
Our VMs are configured to route traffic over Google Cloud’s premium tier network
"Compared to Google Cloud’s standard tier network, the premium tier routes most traffic through Google’s private data centers instead of the public Internet"
This results in lower network latency and faster page load times for your WordPress site
These offer the highest performance per core that GCP offers on Compute Engine and are optimized for compute-intensive workloads
Hardware resources (RAM/CPU) are automatically allocated to each site container by our virtual machines on an as-needed basis
"This is designed to minimize distance and hops, resulting in faster, more secure global transport of your data"
"Some hosting providers might opt for Google’s “standard tier” network service to cut costs, but we believe in only utilizing the best here at Kinsta"
A quality managed WordPress hosting provider should always include automatic backups for no additional charge
"With shared hosts, backups are generally only included in higher-cost plans"
"And if you go the DIY route with a VPS, usually you have to set up your backup system, as well as VPS snapshots, which also cost extra"
You can also restore backups to staging or production
Another advantage that managed WordPress hosting provides is that you usually have access to additional developer-friendly features that you might not get with a shared host
"This includes SSH access, Composer, HeidiSQL, Sequel Pro, and Git"
"Typically, shared hosts won’t give you SSH access, meaning you can’t use any of the above features"
"These can usually be set up if you use a DIY VPS, but it might require additional work"
WP-CLI is a command line tool for managing many-many aspects of a WordPress installation
"It can add/remove users, posts, categories, insert test data, search and replace in the database, and much more"
"For a lot of developers, WP-CLI is a dream come true! And Kinsta’s architecture supports WP-CLI out of the box"
"Our Google Cloud-powered infrastructure focuses on scalability, performance, and security"
The cloud provider your web host uses is also essential
Each site container runs on virtual machines secured behind the GCP firewall
This is a much more secure method than offered by other competitors
"On top of that, we employ encryption at rest to store customer data"
Another critical aspect for any host is scalability
"When it comes to shared hosting, your only option is to upgrade to a higher plan when you outgrow your resources"
And this is if they haven’t already suspended you
"Eventually, with a shared host, you will reach a point where they will force you to migrate to a dedicated server"
This can simply be time-consuming in itself as you’re constantly having to worry about watching your limits
And moving to a better server might require time on your part
"The DIY VPS route is much easier to scale, but sometimes this requires a little more server knowledge to expand disks, etc"
Managed WordPress hosting providers usually handle all of this for you
"If you’re going over their pre-defined limits, they will simply notify you, and if required, an upgrade is just a click away"
"With our isolated software container technology, hardware resources are automatically allocated to each site container by our virtual machines on an as-needed basis"
The result is a hosting configuration that is secure and private by design while simultaneously allowing server resources to scale up or down as needed based on the demands of the site
It's comforting to know your site can handle surges
You won’t get that with shared hosting providers or the DIY VPS method
You would have to sign up separately for the service
"Whenever you type an address into your browser, this routes back to an IP address, even though you never see it"
DNS servers do the mapping for you
"Like with web hosting, there are slow DNS providers and fast ones"
Amazon has one of the largest networks in the world
Going with a fast DNS provider will ensure shorter DNS lookup times
"Typically, the free DNS provided by domain registrars like GoDaddy and Namecheap is very slow"
"It also might not be consistent, and lookup times can vary"
Google Domains is probably one exception because they have such an extensive infrastructure
"The best DNS providers out there are companies like Amazon, Cloudflare, Dyn, and DNS Made Easy, which all have extensive infrastructures specifically designed for DNS"
This is a good example actually of why you need multiple DNS providers
"Many companies’ websites on that day went completely offline because they relied solely on Dyn, the DNS provider under attack"
"Companies like Reddit, Twitter, and Spotify all experienced downtime"
This can be resolved by simply setting up multiple DNS providers ahead of time in preparation
It can be tough to find straight answers to questions about managed WordPress hosting
"To help make things easier, we’ve given our solutions to some of the most-asked questions on the subject"
Managed WordPress hosting is streamlined explicitly for websites that run on the WordPress platform
"The “managed” portion means that the host manages basic administrative tasks for you, like installing updates and setting up automatic backups"
Shared WordPress hosting refers to a hosting setup in which multiple WordPress websites share space on the same server
"This is in opposition to dedicated WordPress hosting, where each WordPress site gets its private server"
"VPS WordPress hosting uses virtual private servers to give each WordPress site its own fully compartmentalized space on a server, often with full access to backend server tools"
"With VPS WordPress hosting, you must manage all hosting maintenance responsibilities, like updates and installations, yourself — a benefit for some, a drawback for others"
Managed WordPress hosting is hosting for WordPress sites where the host handles many administrative server duties for you
"As with any online ecosystem, the world of WordPress hosting doesn’t stand still long"
In last will see the advantages and disadvantages of this protocol
"In this blog, we will what is a firewall, why is it important, how it works, what are its types, and how it protects our network from threats from the internet"
"In this blog, we will mainly learn about the TCP/IP model and its working in detail"
We'll focus on the features and working of each layer of the TCP/IP model
"In this blog, we will learn what is a proxy server, how does it work and what are the various types of proxy servers"
We will also see why we should use a proxy server and what are the risks associated with it
This is a famous interview problem based on dynamic Programming
This question has been asked in big companies like Amazon
Here we need to find the path between the given source and destination that gives the minimum cost
"This is an interview problem asked in companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon"
The problem is to remove duplicates from a sorted array or list
Array and Linked List are the two most used data structures
It's really important to understand and compare the advantages and disadvantages of both array and linked list
"In this blog, we will compare these two linear data structures"
"In this blog, we will mainly learn about the OSI model and its working in detail"
We'll focus on the features and working of each layer of the OSI model

"In this blog, we will learn what is DHCP, what are various entities related to DHCP and how does it work"
We will also discuss how IP configurations are dynamically done
"In this blog, we will learn what happens when type any URL in the address box of a web browser"
"We will see step by step, how the HTTP request is sent and the HTTP response is received"
"In this blog, we will see the difference between a binary search tree and a hash table"
We will see which data structure should be used when to solve our problems
"In this blog, we will learn about the Graph data structure that is used to store data in the form of vertices and edges"
"We will also see some of the properties, types, representation of graph"
The idea of this blog is to discuss the famous data structure called Array
An Array is one of the important data structures that are asked in the interviews
"So, we will learn about arrays and we will also discuss about the idea of the dynamic array and its amortized analysis"
"In this blog, we will learn what is a Network Interface Card, what are its types, what are the various factors that determine the speed of the internet along with the Network Interface Cards speed"
"In this blog, we will learn what is an FTP protocol, how does it works, what are various modes in which it works, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using it"
"In this blog, we will learn why piggybacking is used and how it helps in increasing the efficiency of data transmission"
We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of piggybacking
"In this blog, we will learn one of the flow control method i"
We will discuss various situations that can occur while transmitting the data
We will also mathematically derive the efficiency and the throughput of this protocol
"In this blog, we will learn about the various network traffic types, that are - Unicasting, Anycasting, Multicasting, and Broadcasting"
We'll also see their advantages and disadvantages along with their differences
"In this blog, we will discuss what is an error, what are its types, how to detect these errors"
"We will also know about are various error control techniques like stop and wait ARQ, Go-Back-N ARQ, and Selective Repeat ARQ"
"In this blog, we will learn about various messaging techniques like circuit switching, packet switching, and message switching"
We will also discuss their applications in the real world
Sorting is a famous problem solving approach during the interview
"In this blog, we are going to discuss about the insertion and selection sort algorithm"
"In this blog, we will learn about various SQL commands such as DDL, DML, TCL, DCL"
"To choose the best WordPress hosting, it’s wisest to do your own, fresh research"
Check online reviews for each host and get a feel for how users feel about their services
Determine which hosts have the tools and offerings to save you the most time
And be sure to familiarize yourself with their support processes and availability
"Kinsta ticks all those boxes, and then some"
"Yes, managed hosting costs more money, but you should treat this as an investment in your business"
What a beautiful well written post Brian
Cloudways is also a big name for managed WordPress cloud hosting
What are your thoughts about this platform
Thanks! Glad you enjoyed the writing
I will try to answer this without being too biased :)  Cloudways is a great platform and I know a lot of people that use them
It can also be a good affordable option
The first crowd is typically people just starting out who choose to go with low-cost shared WordPress hosting
"Usually these are people building their first website, migrating away from WordPress"
For three years already my VPS is hosted with RoseHosting
They’ve installed and configured my WordPress site and they also take the security very seriously
Last year my site got hacked
They removed the bad scripts and updated my WordPress to the latest version
My point is that there are some managed VPS providers that give out full support as per the customer needs
"Hi Laura! Yes, “managed” providers typically do provide these services"
Shared hosting and DIY are the ones you have to look out for as that isn’t always included
Please do not take this as me
Either way you would be safer on Kinsta then rosehosting based on their own literature
In addition it is extremely simple remove remember they did not block that script from getting on your site nor did they update your site if it was vulnerable to attacks because it was outdated
Also see panels our weak links in any hosting environment in addition there DNS is awful
Please know that everything I’m saying is to try to let you know that you were very fortunate according to your hosting company’s own website
Brian very well said  as you said said below as a somewhat biased Dyn partner and to deal with on that pager duty infested ( until it went down to) October day
Once I spoke to both companies I now have it set up correctly
I can say with absolute certainty no amount of development skill by a single person will surpass that of the skill set of managed WordPress hosting providers especially the great ones like Kinsta having moved clients on & off of WordPress VIP and everything else under the sun I can say without a doubt that unless someone tells me their budget is five bucks and it’s not going to change I’m going to tell them use a managed WordPress provider
You have been hacked or your WordPress application itself a turn for the worse
Remember if it’s not managed on the app level it’s not managed WordPress
I have never heard a client say they would rather have another cell phone
Remember I’m not trying to get people’s phones taken away their important I’m given an analogy for what we think is a fair price or service
Bryan could not agree with you more on pretty much everything you said awesome journalism
"At the first, I’ve chosen the shared hosting and have experienced some sever issues a few times"
I don’t understand whether its due to shared hosting or the lack of memory limit
I believe that performance is seriously the most important factor for the end users & search engines as well
"Anyway, I needed to “up my game” so I decided to go with WPEngine"
"BUT right before I bought WPEngine, I did a google search just like this “WPengine vs” and I found out about Kinsta"
"I LOVE the staging feature! When I broke my own site on Bluehost, I had a heart attack"
At least with Kinsta there’s a backup and restore feature whenever I do something questionable
Detailed information on Managed WordPress hosting
It’s benefits and other useful features
Great post you have been shared

"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth, and system stability improved immediately"
Kinsta leverages Cloudflare’s secure firewall to protect customer sites
"In addition to the IP-based protection that we currently provide with the Google Cloud Platform firewall, Cloudflare’s firewall solution lets us block malicious traffic with more specific rulesets"
"Overall, this means we’ll be able to provide better protection for your WordPress site"
"DDoS attacks work by flooding sites with large amounts of traffic in a short period of time with the goal of crippling server resources, causing the site to crash"
"DDoS attacks affect millions of sites every year, and can have a huge impact on business revenues"
"With Kinsta CDN enabled, your static assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts, etc"
"Best of all, Kinsta CDN can serve assets from your primary domain, which means you won’t have to deal with complicated setups involving external CDN domains"
"With our Cloudflare integration, all the performance and security features you need are built into the MyKinsta dashboard directly"
This means you won’t have to worry about maintaining a separate Cloudflare account just to take advantage of their services
"Unlike normal SSL certificates which require you list a root domain and individual subdomains that need to be secured, a wildcard SSL allows you to secure a root domain and individual subdomains with a wildcard symbol"
IP address will not be shared by adult or spam sites that are outside of Kinsta’s infrastructure
"If you sign up for Cloudflare directly, your site’s A record IP address is shared by other sites on Cloudflare’s network"
"In some cases, this can cause problems if a service blocks a spam site that happens to share the same Cloudflare IP address as your site"
"Since Kinsta has reserved Cloudflare IPs for sites hosted on our infrastructure, you won’t have to worry about this problem"
Brotli is a state-of-the-art lossless compression format that is supported by all major browsers and achieves better compression ratios than gzip
Brotli continues to rapidly gain in popularity
"Whenever possible, Cloudflare uses the Google Brotli library to dynamically compress web content"
The Brotli file format includes a very large built-in static dictionary that contains various strings in multiple languages
"Going even further, it also supports the option to apply multiple transformations to those words, which increases its versatility"
"Thanks to our Cloudflare integration, all the sites hosted at Kinsta have Brotli compression enabled by default"
"Our customers enjoy the infrastructure and performance of Google Cloud Platform, the power and flexibility of WordPress, and our expert optimizations and support"
"Maintaining many global WordPress sites, we’ve become well acquainted with all the major hosting providers"

"While on-site optimization is important for improved speed, it’s not the only aspect we should look at"
The hardware and network infrastructure supporting our website and connecting it to our visitors also matter
"Today we’ll discuss why Google’s investing a lot of money into their networking infrastructure, and some of the differences in Google Cloud Platform’s premium tier network and standard tier network"
"Before diving into specifics about Google Cloud’s networking, it’s important to first understand the following two concepts: bandwidth and latency"
"Bandwidth is the throughput capacity of the network, measured in Mbps; while latency is the delay or the sum of all delays that different routers along the way add to our web requests and responses"
"Figuratively, bandwidth or throughput can be pictured as water hose capacity to allow a certain volume of water through per second"
Latency can be compared to the delay from the moment the water pipe is opened until it starts gushing through
"Due to the small overhead in establishing the connection between different routers, each “hop” along the way adds a small amount of latency to the final requests and responses"
"So, the farther the visitor and the server where the website is hosted are, the greater the latency will be"
"Also, the more fragmented the network, the bigger the latency"
So it’s the added latency compared to a request to a website hosted in the United Kingdom
The three columns that tracert shows represent three roundtrips (RTT)
Each row represents different routers or hops along the way
They often have URLs that help us determine where that specific router is located
The round-trip time to routers in China / Hong Kong takes close to one-third of a second
Increasing the width of the pipe can increase the website speed only to a certain degree
"It is more useful when we need a big amount of data sent through per second, like when we stream high-definition video content"
"But for users who may be playing real-time multiplayer games online, latency will matter much more"
"To understand our topic a bit better, we need to explain the basics of the internet topology"
"At its core, the global internet consists of multiple global, regional, and local networks"
"These networks belong to governments, universities, ISPs"
These tiers represent the independence of each network on the internet as a whole
"Peering relationship means that two networks exchange traffic on an equal basis, so that none of them pay the other for the transit, and return the same for free"
The main benefit of peering is drastically lower latency
Arrows represent the web request journey
"Dashed arrows represent the transit connections, and full-line arrows represent peering connections"
They can reach all other networks on the internet without paying for transit
The number of hops in this scenario is lower and the website will take much less time to load
"BGP is a protocol that is rarely talked about, except in very technical contexts"
"However, this protocol sits at the very core of the internet as we know it today"
It is fundamental to our ability to access just about everything on the internet and it is one of the vulnerable links in the internet protocol stack
"To put it simply, BGP is a protocol responsible for deciding the exact route of a network request, over hundreds and thousands of possible nodes to its destination"
"We can picture every node as an Autonomous System or a network that would consist of multiple nodes or routers, servers, and systems connected to it"
"These can be commercial interests, like paid transit, or even political or security considerations"
"Due to the growing needs of the IT market, from web industry, online gaming, to the Internet of Things and others, the market space for service providers and products that solve the latency problem became obvious"
This means that even WebAssembly or GO code can be executed very close to the visitor
GaaS is short for Gaming as a Service
It is a cloud offering that gives users the ability to play games hosted and executed in the cloud
"Sensors that relay huge amounts of information in real-time, with minimum latency, to coordinate smart cities, smart houses, autonomous vehicles will depend on dense networks of edge devices"
"By that time, Google was already way ahead of its competition in laying out submarine backbones"
"A year before Amazon’s first investment, ITWorld published an article titled: “Google’s data centers grow too fast for normal networks, so it builds its own”"
That’s why it needs the smallest possible latency and maximum bandwidth possible
"Google also wants to own the actual infrastructure, because its “insatiable hunger” for more bandwidth and latency puts Google, and its peer large scale companies like Amazon or Microsoft, in a position where they need to come up with completely custom hardware and software solutions"
"Points of Presence, or edge PoP nodes, are at the edges of Google’s global private cable network"
There they serve as entry and exit points for traffic connecting to Google’s data centers
One way for cloud providers to keep up with the increasing demand for computing power is clustering
"Clustering, to put it simply, means putting together multiple computers to work on a single problem, to execute processes of a single application"
"Obviously, one precondition to benefit from such a setup is low latency or serious network capacity"
"Up until then, Google was buying clusters of switches from vendors like Cisco, spending a fortune per single switch"
But the equipment still couldn’t keep up with the growth
"Google started building custom switches from commodity silicon chips, adopting a different network topology which was more modular"
"For this new, modular hardware, Google’s team had also to redefine existing protocols and build a custom Network Operating System"
The challenge they were facing was to take vast numbers of switches and routers and operate them as if they were a single system
Espresso is the latest pillar of Google’s SDN
It allows Google’s network to go beyond the constraints of physical routers in learning and coordinating the traffic coming in and going out to Google’s peering partners
"Espresso enables Google to measure connections’ performance in real-time, and base the decision on the best Point of Presence for a specific visitor on real-time data"
"This way, Google’s network can respond dynamically to different congestions, slowdowns, or outages in it’s peering / ISP partners"
"On top of that, Espresso makes it possible to utilize Google’s distributed computing power to analyze all of its peers’ network data"
All the routing control and logic no longer resides with individual routers and Border Gateway Protocol but is instead transferred to Google’s computing network
What we covered so far goes to highlight all the issues and challenges (both hardware- and software-based) Google went through to assemble what is probably the best global private network today available
Amazon cloud debate — fiber!” where they recognize that Google is years ahead in terms of infrastructure
Google Cloud Platform offers two different network tiers which differ both on price and performance
To put it in layman’s terms
"Premium tier packets spend more time on Google’s network, with less bouncing around, and thus perform better (but cost more)"
"This minimizes distance and hops, resulting in faster more secure global transport of your data"
"On the other hand, Standard Tier Network uses Points of Presence near the data center where our content or web app resides"
"This means that our visitors’ traffic will travel through many different networks, Autonomous Systems, ISPs, and through many hops until it reaches its destination"
"In this scenario, speed is compromised"
Content traveling on Standard Tier will not be able to fully reap the benefits of Google’s SDN and the vast computing power to calculate the best routes dynamically
Traffic will be subject to BGP policies of all the systems in between Google and the visitor
To put it in layman’s terms
"Standard tier packets spend less time on Google’s network, and more time playing hot potato on public networks, and thus, perform worse (but cost less)"
"In addition, Premium Tier uses Global Load Balancing, while the Standard Tier offers only Regional Load Balancing, which brings more complexity, and more “footwork” for clients on Standard"
"Premium Tier Network offers a global Service Level Agreement (SLA), which means that Google accepts contractual responsibility to deliver a certain level of service"
It’s like a quality guarantee sign
Standard Network Tiers do not offer this level of SLA
"For years, Google has invested in creating a global networking infrastructure, deploying its own protocols and custom hardware and software networking stacks"
"In times when Moore’s law seems to become weaker year after year, Google’s infrastructure enables the company to keep up with the ever-growing demand for cloud resources"
"We can expect Google to play a key role in the technology of IoT, smart cities, driverless cars, and the demand on edge computing continues to grow"
Google Cloud Network Premium Tier is the first product to make use of Google’s innovative networking achievements
It allows clients to take advantage of Google’s network and the entire stack for delivering content at premium speed
What I would really like to see is an actual test of what user could expect
"Make it more clear what it will save them, that way they can make a even clearer and informed choice"
Because people will still look at this as; costs vs reward
If that can be added that would be wonderful

Nothing is more important to us than the security of your website
Kinsta’s secure WordPress hosting solution implements active and passive measures to stop attacks in its tracks
"We monitor your sites every two minutes for uptime, have very tight software-based restrictions in place, detect DDoS attacks as they happen, and proactively stop malicious code from entering our network"
All sites hosted on Kinsta are protected by Cloudflare’s enterprise-level firewall and includes free DDoS protection
Strong passwords are enforced on all new installs
"We have hardware firewalls, active and passive security, and other advanced features to prevent access to your data"
"But if your site is compromised, we’ll fix it for free"
We only support encrypted SFTP and SSH connections (no FTP) when accessing your WordPress sites directly and offer free Cloudflare certificates to enable HTTPS
"Kinsta uses Linux containers (LXC), and LXD to orchestrate them, on top of Google Cloud Platform which enables us to completely isolate not just each account, but each separate WordPress site"
"All sites hosted on Kinsta are also protected by Cloudflare’s enterprise-level firewall, which includes free DDoS protection"
This is a much more secure method than offered by other competitors
"Because of the sheer scale of Google’s infrastructure, it enables our platform to simply absorb many DDoS attacks automatically"
"Google also has relationships with some of the biggest ISPs in the world, which helps improve the security of your data in transit as it means less hops across the public internet"
They also employ encryption at rest to store customer data
We will also never host a WordPress site that is running on an unsupported version of PHP due to the fact that they no longer have security updates and are exposed to un-patched security vulnerabilities
WordPress minor security patches are also automatically applied as soon as they are available to ensure your site is fully up to date
"Finally, someone recommended we try Kinsta"
We are so thrilled to finally have a true hosting partner that understands and knows how to help us
We are planning a lot of growth in the next year and are grateful to have found a hosting partner we feel confident will help us succeed
Kinsta employs a lot of other security precautions to protect you
We remove the PHP version you're using from the HTTP headers on your WordPress site
Our open_basedir restrictions also don't allow execution of PHP in common directories that are prone to malicious scripts
There is no need to worry about XML-RPC brute force attacks
Don't let the public access it until you or your client are ready
"Not only do users have problems, but even the competition has encountered major security breaches over the past couple years"
This is why it is imperative that you choose a host you can trust that employs the latest security measures
"Maintaining many global WordPress sites, we've become well acquainted with all the major hosting providers"
No one is running our sites as fast as Kinsta
"We truly cannot say enough about the level of customer service that Kinsta provides - it's always a great experience, with very personable and helpful support"
"Absolutely fantastic - cannot rate highly enough in terms of speed, support, and UI"
"Went from WP Engine to Flywheel, then to Kinsta and couldn't be happier"
Kinsta is reliable and makes shipping changes easy
The support team was exceedingly helpful when we needed to migrate our blog
"When we first migrated to Kinsta, the speed difference over our previous VPS was unbelievable"
"It’s been a treat to run our WordPress sites on Kinsta, with total confidence in everything they do to make WordPress run optimally"
"From caching, backups, and developer tools to their fast and reliable support"

Really love the level of experience and support Kinsta's live chat engineers provide
"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth, and system stability improved immediately"
"In fact, it’s a topic that comes up often here at Kinsta"
"While this might conflict with what you’ve read, bear with us"
"In this post, we’ll explain what both a dedicated IP and shared IP address are, and some of the major differences between the two configurations"
"We’ll debunk some of the myths you might have heard regarding how they impact things such as email, SSL, SEO, and more"
"Currently, there are two types of IP addresses being used on the web, and even locally by ISPs and devices such as your home router"
It’s your domain’s home on the web
You can think of this as a dedicated phone line
A dedicated IP is typically assigned to your domain by your WordPress hosting provider or is an add-on that can be purchased for a small fee
A shared IP is quite common nowadays with most WordPress hosting providers
"That’s because, for many configurations, there is no need for a dedicated IP address"
"However, we’ll get into more of the reasoning behind that in a moment"
"Shared hosting typically means that you’re sharing hardware and networking resources with other users on a server, which could include an IP address"
"While a lot of times these go hand in hand, that’s not always the case"
It is the address that other servers see when your site connects to another server
That’s what will be used by services connecting to your domain
That way they can whitelist the IP on their end
"At this point, you may be curious about whether you should use a dedicated IP address for your WordPress sites"
This is a much more reliable approach
"In fact, we never throttle usage here at Kinsta"
"That’s exactly why we use isolated container technology, to ensure that every customer gets the resources they pay for"
Additional port access is another possible advantage
"However, most hosts today block standard ports since they’re easy to abuse, even when issuing dedicated IPs"
"This is usually because they are still using underlying providers such as Google Cloud Platform or AWS, which don’t allow certain ports for communication"
Email is one area where we sometimes recommend getting a dedicated IP
"Even then, we don’t recommend getting a dedicated IP through your hosting provider"
"In fact, if you go with a dedicated IP and only send a low volume of email, it could hurt you"
A good way to think about how email works with typical WordPress hosts is that it’s like shared hosting
You are tied to IP addresses that your host has configured for outgoing email
"Then, you’re suddenly left at the mercy of your host, waiting for it to resolve the issue with the provider or ISP"
"This could result in spotty delivery and wait times for your emails, which is never a good thing"
Third-party email marketing software platforms and transactional email services are set up and configured in such a way that they can greatly increase your odds of hitting your customers’ inboxes
They also have entire teams working day and night to ensure that emails reach their destinations and that their IPs aren’t blacklisted
"Also, you should think of shared IP addresses differently when it comes to outsourcing emails"
Most third-party email services will charge you an additional monthly fee to use a dedicated IP address for sending
"Shared IPs from email services typically are “warmed up”, ready to go, and monitored very closely by experts to ensure high delivery rates"
This is one area that has actually changed quite a bit over the past decade
SNI allows hosting providers to use multiple SSL certificates on a single IP address
"Basically, it sends the visitor the certificate that matches the requested server name"
Let’s take a look at this a bit more closely
"When requests are made, it returns a Cloudflare IP address rather than your origin IP, preventing attackers from being able to directly attack your server"
"When your domain is proxied by Cloudflare, you belong to the pool of IP addresses sharing the Cloudflare network"
"Therefore, the platform doesn’t support dedicated IP addresses"
"First, it’s important to keep in mind that, when discussing anything SEO-related, we can only share what we’ve learned as well as what others have documented in the industry"
"In fact, many of the top brands on the web (Google, Target, CNN, Coca-Cola) are using shared IP addresses to host multiple domains"
A simple reverse-IP lookup reveals this
Notice that we said “quality WordPress hosting”
"Just as with email reputation, IPs can get blacklisted, although typically it’s by domain name rather than IP"
Google is actually quite smart and usually understands that a website may be on shared hosting and you can’t control websites that share the same IP or IP subnet
"Although Google does not blacklist lightly, there are times when you may unintentionally end up on a blacklist, even with no malicious intent or wrongdoing"
"If your IP is supposedly blacklisted, there are some steps you can take to try to “unblacklist” it"
"After you confirm that your network and mail server are properly configured, the first step is to go to the blacklist page and see if it prescribes details for resolving the issue"
"For example, it may ask you to correct something with your DNS records or SMTP banners"
The next step is to scan your computer and network for viruses or vulnerabilities
"If no patches or problems are detected and you’re sure your computer is clean, contact the blacklist site to request removal"
Then carefully follow their IP address removal instructions
"Self-removal generally lets you take yourself off the blacklist quickly, assuming this is the first time your IP address has been blacklisted"
"Time-based removal is an automated process where your IP address is removed after a week or two (or longer, depending on the degree and frequency of offense)"
"Therefore, even though we use shared IP addresses, the risks are minimal to non-existent"
"Based on that experience, we can reassure you that this isn’t something you need to worry about"
"While we’re on the topic of changing IPs, a common question we see is whether or not you can migrate a dedicated IP to a new host"
"Therefore, if you have a dedicated IP on one server, you can’t move it between hosting providers"
You would need to get a new IP address
"This is something to consider if you’re using shared hosting but want to purchase a dedicated IP as an add-on, which we do not recommend"
We’ll explore this a bit further in the next section
"When it comes to WordPress hosting and IP address configuration, another aspect to consider is pricing"
"The costs of a dedicated IP and a shared IP depend on your hosting provider, as well as the length of service"
Some providers include a dedicated IP with high-performance plans or let you purchase one as an add-on feature
"Also, not all providers offer dedicated IPs"
"For more information on the load balancer add-on, please contact our sales team in MyKinsta"
It doesn’t make a lot of sense to choose between a dedicated IP vs shared IP address based on price alone
"Rather, it’s important to consider what’s included in the cost of the type of plan you choose, as well as the quality of the web host"
There are a lot of myths and misinformation out there surrounding dedicated IP and shared IP addresses
"Hopefully, this post helped provide a little insight into which is the better option for hosting your WordPress site"
"Hello Ivan, I think the risk of this happening nowadays is quite low"
"For example, a ton of sites use Cloudflare and Sucuri in front of their origin server"
Cloudflare and Sucuri both use shared IPs
"With such large scale use, I don’t think a company like FB would use generic IP blocking as part of their security protocol"
This article calmed my mind and cleared my doubts on ip issues
I really appreciate the time spent to write this article

"Since I see all the support tickets, I’ve noticed they even try to help my staff in areas out of the Kinsta scope"
They deal with dumb questions in a professional manner

Kinsta APM is our custom-designed performance monitoring tool for WordPress sites
"It helps you identify WordPress performance issues, and it’s free for all sites hosted on Kinsta"
The APM tool provided on all accounts by Kinsta has helped our team make continuous improvements to the optimization of our websites
"The reporting is not only easy to set up, but it’s also straightforward to review and implement updates"
All of the websites hosted on their platform have seen an even larger performance boost once we implemented updates based on the findings of APM
"The Kinsta APM is mind-blowingly easy to turn on, review the results, and find any bottlenecks"
You are armed with the data to make informed decisions for fine-tuning your website
Kinsta APM makes it easy to optimize our website
It supplies us with information about resource-heavy plugins and bottlenecks in the database and website codebase
I believe this is yet another great integration that helps to do even more diagnostics without even leaving the MyKinsta dashboard
Even more so because it reduces relying on third party solutions
"Kinsta APM allowed me to identify a plugin that was seriously slowing down WordPress, and thus my visitors’ experience, leading to a potential loss of revenue"
"While running the tool, there was barely a noticeable difference in the site’s speed, and I didn’t have to run Kinsta APM for more than two hours"
"Over the last year, Kinsta APM has assisted me to figure out several perf bottlenecks that’d be a hassle without it"
"Kinsta’s APM tool gives you a behind-the-scenes look at your website, and clearly shows which plugins are consuming the most resources while visitors browse your site"
"If you’ve got a bad one, APM will reveal it"
"I’m a publisher, not a web developer"
APM simplifies troubleshooting and gets me quickly back to content creation
I was shocked to see this released as a free feature
Good job to the entire Kinsta team
"Kinsta APM captures timestamped information about your WordPress site’s PHP processes, MySQL database queries, external HTTP calls, and lots more"
Kinsta APM is available for free on all plans and can be accessed directly from the MyKinsta dashboard
"With APM, there’s no need to pay for additional licenses or any third-party services"
Performance is our bread and butter
WordPress hosting is what we do best
Kinsta APM is the bridge between these two worlds as it helps you get to the bottom of performance issues on your WordPress sites

A URL is essentially a unique address that will lead to a specific page on a site when entered into a web browser
It’s what makes it easy to share webpages (or YouTube videos) you find interesting with your friends
"With millions of connected servers on the internet, hundreds of millions of websites, and billions of pages, it’s one of the primary technologies that make the web easy to navigate"
"In this post, we’ll do a deep dive into the URL, explain what it is in-depth, break down the individual building blocks of how it works, cover what a good URL looks like for SEO purposes, and more"
"A URL, or uniform resource locator, is an address that helps your web browser locate a specific webpage, picture, file, or other resource"
"Your browser takes the address, translates the domain name to the IP address of the server, and the rest of the URL shows the path to the specific file on that server"
"A URL leads to a specific file or page, while a domain name is the general “address” to the whole website or server"
"A URI (or a Uniform Resource Identifier) is different from a URL in that it refers to the unique ID of a file or resource, but not necessarily the means through which you can access it"
It’s a higher level category of identifiers that also includes URL as one of its subcategories
"It can be a unique name ID, the “location” (or network access point) of the resource, or both (which is what’s referred to as a URL)"
"All of these formats fall under the larger URI umbrella, which covers both URLs and URNs"
"To distinguish between actual links to online resources and the IDs of physical products, web links are typically referred to as URLs rather than URIs"
"To look at an example of a URL, all you need to do is look at the web address field at the top of your browser, right underneath your tabs"
"Notice that when you click on a different tab, it shows a different URL that refers to the page or file you are viewing"
"When you’re just visiting a web page, a URL may seem like the simplest thing in the world"
But a lot can happen in a single URL
Let’s examine the different moving parts of a URL that make all of these things happen
The first part of a URL identifies which protocol the server and webpage use to transfer data to your computer
"Depending on your browser, you may have to double-click the left side of the URL to see this part"
"HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is the basic, unencrypted way of transferring data over the internet"
"HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure and is a more secure, encrypted protocol for transferring data"
"Google Chrome will show that a site uses HTTPS with a lock symbol, symbolizing a secure website"
"If a site uses HTTP, it shows an attention mark that you can expand that warns you against submitting any sensitive information to the site"
"Depending on the browser, website, and operating system, it may also automatically open a prompt that warns visitors"
Just imagine the negative impression this will give potential customers
"Depending on your current web host, it may be as easy as clicking a button or not possible at all"
"In some cases, it might be easier to switch to a more reliable host that uses HTTPS for all sites, like Kinsta"
"The domain name is what helps the browser find your web server in the first place, using the DNS (Domain Name System)"
"Put simply, DNS helps a browser translate a domain name into the actual IP address of the web server connected with it"
They make it easier to share great content and ideas
"Instead of a random string of numbers, you can share or look up a domain name that makes sense"
"The path is any part of the URL that comes after the domain name, before a question mark or # that adds extra information to a URL (more on this below)"
"If you used FTP or a file manager to look at it, it would look identical"
CMS’s rely on the server architecture to connect a normal-looking URL (like kinsta
"If this sounds complicated, and you don’t quite get it yet, don’t worry"
"We’ve got an entire section below dedicated to WP permalinks, how they work, and how you can change them"
"The query string is the part that follows the question mark, and it can include variables that communicate with the PHP on that page to impact the visitor’s experience"
"For example, for WordPress, the “p” variable is short for post and indicates which post WordPress is going to show on that page"
You would need to specify the post ID to WordPress directly to get the page you wanted
URLs like this are no longer a huge concern for social sharing as most social media sites now include previews and meta titles for shared links
But that type of URL can negatively impact the SEO of your website or blog
These UTM tags track where visitors came from to analyze campaign performance
"You can use them to indicate which platform, campaign, and even specific ad sent a visitor"
Some advertising platforms automatically generate parameters to store data about visitors
The anchor is anything that comes behind a hash sign
It’s a page-specific link that leads to a specific part of a page
The URL above will take you to the “The Anatomy of a URL” part of this page because it’s an anchor link or “jump link” to the ID of that specific subheading
You can also add one manually to headers in the Gutenberg editor in WordPress by expanding the “advanced” section of a heading block
"At Kinsta, we don’t bother manually adding IDs to all subheaders"
"Instead, we use a plugin that generates a table of contents and jump links automatically for every article"
"The plugin creates a span around relevant headings with the ID, saving us the trouble of manually adding it"
Including a www in your URL used to be a standard for all websites on the internet
"You may even have noticed that our website, Kinsta"
Whether you use it is mostly down to personal preference
You can set up redirects to the correct form even if visitors don’t include it
"So by default, Google Chrome and many other browsers don’t even show it anymore"
The redirects render it irrelevant to the user experience
"And Google automatically uses the right variation in the search results, so it’s not an SEO factor"
"We briefly touched on this already, but with a CMS like WordPress, the URL path doesn’t represent the “real” path through existing folders and files on your server"
That’s what the original WordPress permalink was
"Thankfully, you don’t need to understand your server ecosystem or how to do this manually to make any changes to your URL"
You can handle it all from within WordPress (as long as your server environment is set up correctly)
Most WordPress sites avoid this for SEO reasons
"A random number string can’t include a matching keyword, and is less clickable than a link that makes sense"
"Instead, most sites use a structure that includes a blog title, or a variant of it, in the URL"
"If we let WordPress handle it, the permalink for this post would be something like kinsta"
"It’s simply too long, and not ideal for sharing or SEO either"
Just expand the “Permalink” section in the right-hand sidebar when creating any page or post
"But when it comes to web addresses and WordPress, URL isn’t the only term we use"
You may also have heard the word permalink or slug
"Slugs should be short, readable, and clearly indicate the content of the page or post"
A URL is simply any web address that you can use to access a page or file
It’s a basic web technology that helps you navigate the internet
"If you move an old page or post, you might wonder if there’s any way to ensure you can still get the traffic and links from the old URL"
"Luckily, redirects are easy to set up"
The status code indicates to the browser and search engine crawlers the status of the redirect
"It’s ideal for SEO, as it passes most of the original authority and “link juice” the old article had to the new one"
"If a URL is extra-long, it may be tempting to use a URL shortener when sharing it in social media posts or emails"
"If you’re linking to a specific part of a post with a long anchor, or want to hide your UTM parameters, it’s a good idea"
"A shortened URL (or short link) is mostly useful for sharing on social media, emails, or in videos"
"By now you should be familiar with what a URL is, all the way down to its building blocks of domain name, path, and the underlying protocols"
"To get the most out of your site’s URLs, it’s important to keep them short and to the point, and include the topic of every page"
"Don’t forget to redirect old URLs when you make changes, especially for ones that have already attracted backlinks and were generating organic traffic to your site"
"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth, and system stability improved immediately"

"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth, and system stability improved immediately"
"And there will be next time, you can count on it"
Perhaps your host has reached out saying your site is overloading the server
"Or perhaps you’ve noticed something is dragging your site down, like the ever so popular admin-ajax"
"Before throwing your hands up in the air and calling it quits, follow the recommendations below"
"And in fact, that is just how I originally found out that my site was having problems"
This pertains to both uptime and performance monitoring
If a site goes down the Kinsta team knows about it before you do
"If a site we are monitoring goes way over acceptable internal performance thresholds, we will also reach out to you and help troubleshoot the issue with your site"
"Lastly, it might be something that is easily fixable"
There are a couple places in New Relic that can help narrow down performance issues fast
The first is the “WordPress → Plugins and themes” tab
"On my woorkup site, which I am using as a case study today, I could instantly see that the issue I was encountering was most likely coming from the “gp-premium” plugin I have running"
But it’s always recommended to at least check there first
The next step was to dig into the admin-ajax
You can click into the “Trace Details or “Database queries” tabs
Remember from above we were seeing that “gp-premium” was supposedly the plugin causing the issue
"Usually, if you are seeing it both in the plugin/theme section as well as the trace section, its a good indicator that this is a good place to start"
"The next step was to head to Google! Yes, Google can actually be quite helpful in cases like these"
Upon reading the description I could see that this was used for image processing for WordPress themes
Essentially image sizes are quietly generated in the background using WP Queue
They can be like breadcrumbs for troubleshooting
This is by far one of the easiest ways to narrow down issues
"Simply go to Plugins, select all of them and choose “Deactivate” from the bulk options"
After doing this response times in New Relic immediately dropped back down to normal on my site
So I knew it was a plugin causing the problem
"And due to the fact that I had already done some troubleshooting above, I had a hunch it was still the “gp-premium” plugin"
So I re-enabled the “gp-premium” plugin to verify that I could replicate the issue
"And yes, load times (web transaction times) immediately went back up"
"Whenever you have queues of any type, always check these areas"
"In fact, I always recommend checking them"
"So as I said earlier, this didn’t happen on my other sites that were using GeneratePress"
They also didn’t have those extra transient rows in the database
Perhaps upon upgrading something didn’t get deleted as it was supposed to
So it appears that it’s not the developer’s fault but rather probably simply a corruption of the transient cache
This could have happened with any plugin or theme
"If you didn’t understand any of the above, well then I highly recommend looking at the rest of the steps below when it comes to troubleshooting issues like these"
These features and tools help protect your site and troubleshoot issues fast
This is also where our expert support team here at Kinsta can help if you run into issues like the crazy one described above
Our support team deals with unique and complex problems like these every day
"And even though we can’t fix bad code for you, we can usually at least help point you in the right direction"
"This might involve a similar process such as enabling New Relic, letting it run for a while, and then letting our team become the WordPress detectives for a moment"
As they say on their page: “Say hello to your new WP CTO!” Btw
"After you narrow down what might be the cause of your WordPress performance issue, don’t be afraid to raise the issue with the developer! A lot of times developers are more than happy to help, and in fact, want to know about things when they break so that they can roll out fixes for everyone"
"We are tossing up the problem to corrupt transients, but as you can see he is actually going to be switching up their image queueing method (partially because of this)"
So your feedback as a user can definitely help developers make higher-level decisions regarding what might be best to implement or change in their plugins or themes
Perhaps you discovered that the plugin you’re using does have some bad code and the creator can’t or won’t fix it
Or perhaps you need additional performance optimizations beyond the scope of our support team here at Kinsta
"They only want the best of the best, which in turn can save you a lot of time and frustration as a customer"
"Whether your tech-savvy or not, there are always solutions available to you when it comes to solving WordPress performance issues"
The first obvious recommendation is set yourself up for success by choosing a hosting provider that has not only a rock-solid infrastructure but also a world-class support team to back it up
The last thing you want to happen is your WordPress site goes down or starts to crawl simply because you didn’t know which steps to take next
Take advantage of the amazing tools out there like New Relic which will simply save you time when debugging issues
"And when it comes down to it, there are tons of talented WordPress developers in the community"
Don’t be afraid to hire one
"Thanks Brian!  Like always, a very original and informative article"

"Migration of the site over to these guys is a complete simple breeze, they do it all once you send them the site details, although if you are not sure they are on hand to assist you anyway via the online message box in the admin area of your dashboard"
"The free migration I received was the first time a host migrated a site and got all the little details correct, not forgetting things, etc"
"If you have problematic high traffic sites like us, you’ll love their migration service -- they took care of everything and even identified some problem plugins that had been installed by former members of our team"
I would have spent hours on the migration due to the size without their help
"Everything is interconnected over their premium tier network, designed to minimize distance and hops, resulting in fast and secure transport of your data"
Kinsta’s platform and dashboard was designed with beginners in mind and yet it’s packed with advanced features and tools developers will love

Fintech company Hardbacon was tired of experiencing downtime and low-performance rates
They needed a host that would support their business
"Intuit needed a hosting solution that could handle millions of visitors per month, fulfill unique SLA requirements, and had high-availability"

A web hosting provider doesn’t only serve your website files to visitors
"It controls how your website works, how fast it loads, its availability during outages, and its security — all of which directly impact your customer’s user experience and the success of your website as a sales tool"
"In recent years, Google’s cloud hosting solution has risen to prominence and established itself as a leading service for millions of customers"
"If you’re considering Google as an option, we’ve compiled the top advantages of choosing Google Cloud hosting to help you make your decision — including why we think it’s currently the best solution on the market"
A fundamental factor in the success of your website is its availability
"You can have the best content or product in the marketplace, but none of that will matter if visitors can’t access your website"
This is the time when prospective followers and customers will most likely seek out your competitors
Your hosting provider has a direct influence on your website uptime
There’s very little you can do to increase uptime on your own
"Beyond avoiding errors in your code, you’re entirely reliant on your hosting provider"
"However, after significant research, there doesn’t appear to be a definitive or reputable study crowning the most reliable cloud platform (yet)"
"Another huge advantage of Google Cloud hosting, especially here at Kinsta, is the live migration of virtual machines (VMs)"
This allows us as a WordPress hosting provider to maintain the availability of your website — with no noticeable degradation in performance — when live-migrating VMs between host machines
Implementing a solution to perform uptime checks lets you automatically track the availability of your hosting setup and be alerted in the event of any outages
This allows you rapidly respond to any issues inside your control and minimize downtime while also tracking whether your provider meets their SLA
Creating uptime checks and alerting policies is a simple process
It’s also completely free to monitor your Google infrastructure (though monitoring technology outside Google Cloud will cost extra)
One of the biggest things setting Google Cloud hosting apart from other players is their global network
"It’s easily one of the biggest in the world, rivaling the global infrastructure of both Microsoft and Amazon"
Comparing the global infrastructure of the top three cloud providers is no easy task
"They each use different terminology to describe their global network, and certain data points aren’t publicly available"
The existence of a global network will play a pivotal role in your user experience
A larger and more geographically distributed network lets you offer local access to more people
This means more of your end users will enjoy a faster and better user experience when visiting your website
"Google Cloud offers several hosting advantages within their leading global infrastructure, which we’ll detail below"
Network throughput measures how many packets of data successfully arrive at their destination in a set timeframe
Packet loss creates slow and poor-performing networks
"This, in turn, will create slow speed in your applications and impact your users"
"In short, your website will take longer to load, especially in peak traffic situations"
"Having created a massive network of real-world infrastructure, the Google Cloud Platform can support the vast majority of the journey from the user to your resources"
"Customers gain access to their cutting-edge network, bypassing congested public internet routing and minimizing the number of traceroute hops for faster performance"
Let’s look at how the Google Cloud Platform Network Service Tiers break down
"The Premium tier, the more expensive of the two options, is designed for high-performance routing"
The Premium tier is built for speed
The user is picked up from the internet service provider (ISP) at the nearest PoP
"They then travel through the Google Network using cold-potato routing, an approach that limits the distance and the number of traceroute hops for faster and more secure transport"
You also get the added benefit of global load balancing
One massive load balancer splits your traffic among servers into different regions instead of multiple load balancers for each region
"This lets you use a single anycast IP address for your whole network, which is only possible when you have total control over the underlying hardware"
You’re protected with a Global Service Level Agreement (SLA) in this setup
"This binds Google through a contract to deliver a certain level of service, where you’d be compensated if they fail to reach those levels"
The Standard tier is about optimizing your network for cost at the expense of peak performance
"However, you will still access performance levels that are competitive with other cloud providers"
Most of your traffic travels the existing internet service provider’s (ISP) networks with standard routing
"Traffic is handled with a hot-potato approach where it’s passed through many networks, autonomous systems, and ISPs before reaching its final destination"
Speed is compromised when there are more hops before data reaches the users
"There is also more complexity in the Standard tier, as you will only have access to regional cloud load balancing services"
"This means more “footwork” for you as the client, whereas you have global load balancing for your setup in the Premium tier"
The Standard tier also doesn’t come with the Global SLA offered by the Premium tier
"So, in the rare event of performance standards not being met, you won’t be compensated for lack of service"
The Google Cloud Platform was the first major public cloud provider to offer a tiered cloud network
"Like any new and unique product launched in the cloud space, it wasn’t long until the other significant players joined the party"
Both providers offer a similar solution to the GCP Network Service Tiers
Traffic is accepted close to the user through one of their many PoPs
It’s then routed over their global networks
"Despite already offering planet-scale infrastructure, Google remains committed to growing and improving its global network"
They focus on expanding into new regions and countries to produce more network edge locations
"This growth trend will, in turn, improve your ability to deliver an exceptional user experience to customers visiting your website"
You’ll be able to offer ever-lowering latency and ever-heightening performance through more locations across the world
"These include Warsaw (Poland), Delhi (India), Melbourne (Australia), and Toronto (Canada)"
"It’s not just new regions worth mentioning, but also Google’s commitment to better connecting their infrastructure with subsea cables"
These new connections accelerate data delivery as they carry our digital lifeblood from one side of the globe to the other
"Our Google Cloud-powered infrastructure focuses on scalability, performance, and security"
A top advantage of Google Cloud hosting is the ease of deploying a new web hosting solution
"These click-to-deploy solutions offer a preconfigured setup that typically comprises a virtual machine server, operating system, storage disk, content management system, and database"
They’re available at an affordable price without expending the time and effort required to source what you need to get started
All Google Cloud’s click-to-deploy hosting solutions are customizable
"So, once you’re up and running your day-one deployment, you can come back at a later time to adjust and further optimize the solution"
"This solution offers an out-of-the-box setup of WordPress on the Compute Engine platform, available with a range of hosting options at various price points"
The support available from Google is undoubtedly one of the main advantages of Google Cloud hosting
"This comes in three forms, which we’ve detailed below"
Choosing one of Google’s paid Customer Care plans unlocks advanced support for the full range of their cloud technologies
"There are three paid support plans available — Standard, Enhanced, and Premium support"
"As you move upwards through the paid support plans, you unlock additional support formats, accelerated response times, more communication channels, greater availability, and escalation choices for more immediate issues"
It also comes with a dedicated Technical Account Manager to help optimize your Google Cloud Platform usage
"You can fully customize and tailor your support across every product and service, even gaining access to hands-on training"
"Even if you don’t choose a paid support plan, you gain free access to a vast community of enthusiasts and experts who can provide support as a Google Cloud customer"
The Google Cloud Platform has one of the most comprehensive collections of support documentation out there
"If you have a mind for technology and prefer a DIY approach, you’ll find everything you need in that documentation to troubleshoot your web hosting issues"
"The platform offers guides, code samples, architectural diagrams, best practices, tutorials, API references, and more, all so that you can learn about and troubleshoot every aspect of your Google Cloud setup"
"Best of all, it’s completely free"
Security is a primary concern for any business
"The same system secures their top products, including Gmail and Google Search"
You can also rest easy knowing that Google’s team of industry-leading security and privacy experts is dedicated to enhancing the platform’s state-of-the-art security
Our approach secures and isolates each account and each separate WordPress site
"We achieve this using Linux containers (LXC), and LXD to orchestrate them, on top of the Google Cloud Platform"
"As you can see, there are numerous advantages in choosing Google Cloud hosting and utilizing the Google Cloud Platform for your website"
"Thanks to the platform’s simplicity and click-to-deploy hosting configurations, getting started is easy"
"Once hosting is up, your website will load at lightning speed and almost always remain available thanks to one of the world’s leading cloud networks"
"You can even choose network service tiers, giving you the power to enhance performance at a cost"
You and your customers can benefit from the peace of mind of knowing that sensitive data is protected by state-of-the-art security and a team of experts
"Improved Performance – great results, but if your clients migrated to and from crappy hosting providers then of course you’ll get such dramatic results"
"In fact, many of our clients come to us from WP Engine because of performance reasons"
"Hi Brian, Thanks for the post, I was looking for a cloud hosting for my Magento store, No doubt, In fact, all the written points are concerned with the person who is looking for cloud hosting, selecting Google for hosting is not a bad choice over other hosting companies like Kyup or Vultr"
"There’s a value of AWS for the cloud that I have studied to another blog, but, Being a Magento owner, I also suggest people choose Google for cloud-like me, I never faced any issue"
"Security, Backup, Server response rate, load time, Everything is now like a part of high quality website and hosting matters a lot as Google has announced the algorithm for penalizing websites with low site speed"
"So in regards to SSL certs (you can do free Let’s Encrypt certs yourself), auto backups, and caching… these are typically provided by the host"
"Even the auto-scaling part is typically configured in a way by the host to work correctly, although this is powered by Google Cloud Platform behind the scenes"
"Unfortunately, we don’t host Magento sites"
We only focus on one platform: WordPress
This ensures we are the best in the industry
Those supporting multiple platforms tend to spread themselves thin
This results in subpar support and infrastructures that aren’t as specifically tailored or optimized for your platform
Wanting to compare to what price would be in Google Cloud
"Nowadays, all day to day storage of data is being done on the cloud"
Great work you have been shared
Using GCP in itself does not affect search rankings just because it’s a Google product
"However, GCP is a very high performance infrastructure platform"
"Since Google takes page load time into account, having a fast site on GCP can help with SEO"

"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth, and system stability improved immediately"
This is the IP address you’ll need to point your domain to at your DNS provider
"This means the owner of the IP address is Cloudflare, Inc"
"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth, and system stability improved immediately"
"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"However, when we actually started operating the system, we discovered several problems, which led us to consider replacing it"
There were three issues at the time
The first issue was an increase in development and operation costs
It costs a lot to develop and operate a CMS in-house
"However, since its scope is limited to internal usage within the company, a large return cannot be expected"
That inevitability makes it difficult to invest in development and operation
"Even though it was a CMS for internal use, it was essential to have an easy-to-use system in order to rapidly create high-quality content"
"Yet we lacked strong investment in development after the initial release due to high costs and low return on investment, as mentioned above"
"As a result, no system improvements were made after the initial release, and content creators continued to use a very inconvenient UI and infrastructure"
"Without a doubt, that in turn led to lower-quality content"
"Finally, the third issue was that the old CMS became a factor that reduced the stability of our other systems"
"Since the CMS we developed in-house was a headless CMS, the actual content display was done by another web application"
"This web application needed to call the API of the headless CMS, but when this API went down, the entire web application would often go down as collateral damage"
Time for drastic measures to put an end to snowballing costs
"The team looked toward a SaaS solution, with Kinsta rising to the top of of possible candidates"
"Increased development costs had become a bottleneck, and so we decided to move to SaaS"
The question was which SaaS to move to
"From our research, we narrowed it down to a couple of candidates, including Kinsta, and there were three great things about Kinsta in particular that we focused on"
"First, on Kinsta we can use WordPress, the most popular CMS in the world"
"We already had a department in our company that was using WordPress, so we had some familiarity with it"
"Also, since many people use it for a wide variety of purposes, we recognized that its functionality and scalability are very appealing"
"Second, Kinsta’s managed service has a broad reach"
"Although it’s easy to get started with WordPress, it’s a headache to keep PHP and WordPress properly up to date"
"With Kinsta, PHP and WordPress updates can be done with just a few clicks, and CDN and domain management can be done from the UI"
"These were features we were looking for, as we wanted to focus on content creation and service development"
"Third, Kinsta’s price is reasonable for the features"
"With all of Kinsta’s rich managed features mentioned above, the price is relatively low compared to the services we were considering"
We chose Kinsta because of its superiority on the above three points in comparison to the competition
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth"
"First of all, thanks to the switch from our own CMS to WordPress, we are now able to create high-quality content faster"
"This is thanks in large part to Kinsta’s high-quality UI and system design, as well as the assistance provided by its wide variety of powerful features"
"In addition, since WordPress is so widely used, many content creators already have experience using it in the past"
"Even if they run into problems, solutions are readily available online, which reduces the cost of exposition and research"
The most remarkable thing for us is the stability of Kinsta’s system
"Before we moved to Kinsta, every year we had several malfunctions that affected our users, but since migrating to Kinsta, those problems have completely disappeared"
"This is not only because Kinsta itself is highly stable, but also because the probability of failure has been reduced because we no longer need to link multiple systems through an API"
Another reason is that middleware and plugins are now kept properly updated
"With our proprietary CMS in the past, updates of middleware and libraries tended to go neglected"
"Now, we use Kinsta’s functions to upgrade our PHP and WordPress versions, and we have created a mechanism for automatic plugin updates by maintaining CI/CD semi-automatically"
Kinsta is the solution to staff limitations; future-proofing is key
We’d love to have you on board

Multisite networks come with a unique set of challenges and obstacles that make scalability and uptime especially critical

"We’ll discuss what distinguishes Kinsta from other WordPress hosting providers, and explore the benefits of using Kinsta as your Multisite hosting solution"
"Unlike other hosting providers, Kinsta doesn’t fall into any of the categories of traditional hosting, such as shared, VPS, or dedicated"
"Kinsta’s unique, powerful infrastructure was built from scratch to enable us to deliver unparalleled performance"
Our platform is backed by the innovative technology and resources needed to support WordPress Multisite networks
We also use LXD-managed hosts and LXC software containers for every site hosted on our platform
"This means that your entire network will have its own isolated container equipped with all the necessary resources, including MySQL, PHP, Linux, and Nginx"
"This is important because, unlike with traditional shared hosts, you won’t have to worry about sharing resources or your network being compromised"

"Plus, our scalable infrastructure enables you to upgrade or downgrade with ease"
This means you can strategically select any of our locations worldwide for your Multisite network to reduce network latency and ensure lightning-fast loading times
Another way we can help optimize the speed and performance of your Multisite network is through our unique caching system
We use a variety of caching solutions to eliminate the need for external plugins or add-ons
This is particularly helpful when you’re managing multiple WordPress sites
"To reduce server load and accelerate response times, we use Bytecode, Query cache, Page, and CDN cache, as well as support for Object cache if needed"
"It's as though the folks at Kinsta tried every other hosting company and then thought to themselves ""hmmm"
"But by far, the best thing is their infrastructure for managing the websites as well as how it is layered on top of the biggest and baddest ass hosting platform in the world, Google Cloud"
One of the ways we do that is with our custom user portal
"We understand how important cloning and staging environments are for testing plugins, themes, and core updates, to ensure that they won’t break your websites before pushing them live"
That’s why we offer one-click staging

Your domain is your digital street address
"Even if you throw a fresh coat of design on it, get the wrong address in the spammy part of the neighborhood, and you could be losing customers before they ever see your website"
"Get the right one, however, and your address opens the door for visitors to come in and stay a while"
It instills a sense of professionalism and polish that starts at the address bar
"In the (very) beginning of the internet, domain names weren’t initially used"
"This, obviously, became pretty impossible to manage once the internet started to grow"
"Words, far easier to remember than that number string, came into circulation as a new method for reaching websites"
Here are the eight strategies we’ve seen work
"And while this seems like a pretty common sense limit, it’s not as clear-cut as it sounds"
How “items” fall in human memory depends on the items themselves and whether they associate with any other memory systems
"Which means that, although a website address like “www"
"Obviously, this example falls apart if someone has a background in biology, but it illustrates the point I mean to make"
"The more recognizable the elements of your domain name are, the easier — and therefore more usable — your address becomes"
"As a rule of thumb, try to keep the elements involved limited to no more than seven"
"Often referred to as “Miller’s magical number,” a multitude of studies conducted over the last few decades have found that the limits to short-term memory “chunks” (elements) is seven, plus or minus two"
"But, given the “buffer” deterioration people experience when made to remember more items, if you can pare it down further than seven, that’s even better"
"They’re short, simple, and everyone knows how to spell them"
"Although both of these domain names hit the mark for memorable, they lose points for being an easy typo, and in Comic-Con’s case, requiring users to switch between their digital keyboards to type"
"So, when you’re picking your domain name, try it out on your mobile phone first"
Keywords in domain names are a lot like powdered sugar on waffles
They don’t carry the weight that they used to and have negative associations (with users and search engines) that you should avoid
"Good to add in moderation, but unnecessary, and if abused, likely to end up with disappointing results at your next website physical"
"Otherwise, stick to what makes sense, and prioritize memorable, typable, and brandable (that’s our next tip) well above keywords"
No domain name strategy list would be complete without talking about the importance of branding
"Examples of highly-branded domain names include Amazon, IBM, and Tesla"
"But if you’re struggling, there are marketplaces for this, albeit at a pretty penny"
"You’ve registered your domain name…but lo and behold, a few weeks later you receive a cease and desist letter from the law offices of someone who makes five times as much money as you every thirty seconds"
"It’s not a pretty picture, but it’s not an uncommon one, either"
Making sure your potential domain name isn’t trademarked is an absolute must if you want to avoid getting caught in unwanted litigation
"For various reasons related to our WordPress trademark, we ask if you’re going to start a site about WordPress or related to it that you not use “WordPress” in the domain name"
"Try using “wp” instead, or another variation"
"We’re not lawyers, but very good ones tell us we have to do this to preserve our trademark"
"Also, many users have told us they find it confusing"
"Simply put, don’t take the risk"
"Additionally, if your website will operate outside of the US, now or in the future, you’ll want to get familiar and check trademarks in those respective countries, as well"
This brings us to our last strategy for choosing your domain name: figuring out what ends it
"But there are a lot more domain extensions than there used to be, and if used strategically you shouldn’t have any problems"
And that’s good news for a new website
Because the new domain suffixes — the
"And affordability is a factor that, unless you’re a monster conglomeration, has to be balanced against the other elements"
"If not, you’re better off going with a new domain extension"
"Given the trend, the acceptability of it will only increase with time, similar to domestic wines"
"Ultimately, the litmus test for an extension will depend on how closely your domain name adheres to the other factors outlined here like brandable, memorable, and typable"
"This wraps our strategies for choosing your domain name, though the next one could be considered a bonus strategy"
"If you’re having trouble coming up with a name, there are a variety of generators out there that can make it easier"
Let’s run through a few now
Trying to come up with a domain name that meets all of these requirements can definitely be easier said than done
"Fortunately, you can put some of the responsibility on a generator if your creative team needs a break"
Just input a keyword and check out all of the available domains
"It even outputs domains that sound like it, rhymes with, and random suggestions"
"If you’re in the music tech industry, you may want to snag that domain name ASAP"
"You just type in a word, select your extensions, hit the button “Go,” and wait for the results to tab up"
"What it lacks in design, it makes up for in clever suggestions and simplicity"
"Second, if the domain is currently being used by an existing brand that you are trying to acquire, make sure to check out its traffic patterns"
A constant downwards trend could possibly mean it was hit by a Google penalty at some point
Or it could simply mean that they stopped working on the domain
"Again, when it comes to acquiring an existing domain, make sure to check all aspects of it"
"If you don’t know how, there are plenty of great SEO experts in the community you can hire"
Domain names are your digital street address
They can significantly shape a visitor’s perception of your brand
"Unfortunately, most of the one-hit names like “Dogs"
But that doesn’t mean you can’t find a great domain name for your new website
Finding the perfect domain name is a lot like finding the perfect song
What works best for your business and resonates most with users will inevitably change
"But following these eight tips, you’re sure to have a domain name that stands the test of time"
Wow! Kinsta…I don’t only say this I mean it
I read three of the best “domain name” tutorials before I read yours
"Although the others were good, yours is the best"
I actually laughed at your amazing tone and expression
"Your tutorial was not too sales-oriented, I felt your energy you’re really honest and helpful"
What really captured me was what you said about the extensions gaining momentum
Which is what others failed to mention
I thought the same when I registered a

One of the worst things to experience with your network is a sudden slowdown
"Slow networks can be a disaster if you’re in the middle of an important business process, trying to impress a client, or rushing to complete an urgent task"
"These risks become greater as your business connects to cloud servers, uses more applications, or expands to include remote workers and branch offices"
"If you’re wondering how to improve latency, I highly recommend understanding and setting up processes for checking and reducing this problem across your network, so when a problem arises, you’re already equipped to handle it"
"The closer your latency is to zero, the better"
"Determining your network latency and improving it so network processes run faster is important for business efficacy, as well as simply making your workday less frustrating"
"Before you can improve your network latency, it’s important to first understand how to determine your latency and the different ways you can measure it"
"By knowing your latency, you can better troubleshoot any problems you’re having to ensure data travels more quickly"
IT administrators or professionals will typically use network monitoring and management tools to get this information automatically
"First, make sure other people on your network aren’t using up all the bandwidth or increasing your latency with lots of downloads or streaming"
"Then, check application performance to ensure no applications are acting in unexpected ways and putting pressure on the network"
Subnetting can also help reduce latency across your network as you can group together endpoints that communicate most frequently with each other
"Additionally, consider using traffic shaping and bandwidth allocation measures to improve latency for the business-critical parts of your network"
"Finally, you can use a load balancer to help offload traffic to parts of the network with the capacity to handle some additional activity"
"If you want to make sure latency issues are on your network, you can try disconnecting computers or network devices and restarting all the hardware"
Make sure you also have a network device monitor installed so you can check if any of the devices on your network are specifically causing issues
"Be aware, even if you fix a bottleneck somewhere in your network, you might simply be creating another one somewhere else"
"If you still have latency problems after thoroughly looking at all your local devices, it’s possible the issues are coming from the destination you’re trying to connect to"
"Troubleshooting issues across a large network becomes complex when you try to pinpoint an issue manually, and I generally recommend troubleshooting tools and software to help you with this task"
"Testing network latency can be done by using ping, traceroute, or My TraceRoute (MTR) tool"
More comprehensive network performance managers can test and check latency alongside their other features
"The importance of measuring and reducing latency cannot be overstated, as maintaining a high-performance and reliable network is a big part of having a successful business"
"If managed poorly network issues can become a substantial business risk, so using appropriate management protocols and tools is vital for any professional enterprise"
"Using tools to improve network latency is familiar to most network professionals, and there are several different options with network latency measuring features"
All these tools can help you measure network latency across the entire network or between points
"A network diagram provides a visual representation of a computer network, displaying how the individual components of a network interact"
"This includes routers, hubs, firewalls, devices, and other components"
"Depending on the scope and purpose, a network diagram may provide a simple overview of the network or a more detailed network diagram"
"As an example, a Local Area Network (LAN) diagram might show the IP addresses of individual devices, while a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) diagram might represent areas or buildings with a single node"
A network diagram can be physical or logical
"Different types of network diagrams include network switch diagrams, computer network diagrams, and network security diagrams"
Each of these network diagrams focuses on a single component or aspect of a network
A logical network diagram addresses how information passes through a network
This means a logical network diagram will usually display subnets (i
"A physical network diagram, as its name suggests, shows the actual physical arrangement of the network components"
"This type of diagram provides a bird’s-eye view of the network in a physical space, much like a floorplan"
"Because network diagrams provide insight into how network components interact, they can be useful for several reasons"
"Network diagrams can help you plan the structure of a new home or professional network, in addition to supporting the coordination of updates to an existing network"
"Network diagrams can also be used to report and troubleshoot network problems, while helping ensure your business complies with PCI and other requirements"
"Businesses often use network diagrams as documentation for external communication, onboarding, and training activities"
A clear and detailed network diagram can save businesses a significant amount of time when onboarding new team members
It also serves as a helpful reference point to help solve network issues quickly and efficiently
"Network diagrams are also useful for keeping track of components, sending relevant information to a vendor for a request for proposal (RFP) without needing to disclose sensitive information, selling a network proposal to stakeholders, and proposing high-level syslog infrastructure alterations"
Creating a detailed network diagram can be time-consuming and resource intensive
"To ensure your network diagram is accurate, it should be created by a highly experienced member of your team who’s familiar with different types of network diagrams"
"This should include network switch diagrams, computer network diagrams, and network security diagrams"
The individual or team responsible for creating the network diagram should also have a proven understanding of which type of diagram is best suited to your company’s requirements
An automated network diagram tool can save you time and resources by creating the network diagram for you
Some of the best software for network diagrams can automatically detect your network and map it out according to your custom settings
"Network diagramming software should be featured in every network administrator’s toolkit, ensuring your network diagrams are accurate, up to date, and clear"

"With NTM’s robust reporting capabilities, keeping track of inventory and network information is easier than ever"
"Microsoft Visio is a high-end, enterprise-grade chart and map creating tool in widespread use among businesses across different industries"
"Visio is so popular, many other network diagram tools, including SolarWinds NTM, allow their users to export network maps to Visio"
"Because of this, Visio is a great tool for consolidating information from multiple sources"
Visio helps speed up your topology mapping tasks by giving you access to IT icons and network design templates
"It gives you the choice of different network topology templates, connector tools, and shapes for planning or documenting any kind of system"
This helps you understand connections and troubleshoot errors
"Visio allows you to create overview or detailed network diagrams, giving you the option of documenting the broad strokes of a network or describing every detail at the device level"
You can create difficult diagrams or data layers to be shared with stakeholders
"This tool lets you share, edit, and comment on diagram drafts, enabling collaboration between colleagues"
"You can then exclude sensitive data when sharing diagrams with stakeholders, to keep them safe"
Another advantage of using Visio is it helps you ensure compliance with industry regulations
"You can create detailed network diagrams to help your business meet IT requirements for the payment card industry, federal data centers, and much more"
Visio is easy to use and can save you a significant amount of time by allowing you to consolidate information and import relevant data directly into your diagram

"Kinsta backups provide you with a complete snapshot of a site environment’s files, database, redirects, and Nginx configuration at the time the backup was created"

You can use these to restore your site in one click from the MyKinsta dashboard

Kinsta’s speed obsessive architecture along with its auto-scaling and WooCommerce optimizations make it a winning combination for your online store
"Network scanning can offer critical insights into devices and performance, making it easier to troubleshoot issues"
"There are manual ways to perform some of these tasks, but I suggest using a network scanning tool for optimal results"
The scanner then looks at the responses it gets to see if there are inconsistencies or vulnerabilities
"Using the necessary Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) scan is more complicated, but it can be done—you’ll need to use echo, timestamp, or subnet mask requests"
This method is often used to map network topology
"Network scanning is used to recognize available network services, discover and recognize any filtering systems in place, look at what operating systems are in use, and to protect the network from attacks"
It can also be used to determine the overall health of the network
"If you’d like to track the packet-level traffic on your network, you’ll need to implement sensors on managed devices and applications and deploy a tool for you to easily translate packet data into intelligible and relevant information"
This approach looks at network information as soon as a device or system appears and starts sending messages to the network
"In reality, networks release a lot of information in their normal communications, enough that passive scanners can simply look at this traffic flow, rather than pinging the devices themselves"
"This can help reveal traffic types, protocols, and bottlenecks within the network"
It can also reveal potential security risks by catching anomalies
"However, it’s an important form of network scanning and should be part of your toolkit"
Trying to manually manage a large network is difficult and can expose your business to major security risks
"There are several different scanning tools on the market, each with a slightly different approach to the task"
This tool primarily uses passive scanning to reveal a wide range of critical network information
"It functions as a network discovery and performance management tool, allowing you to determine what devices and applications are on your network and create instant network topologies"
"You can scan the network information to determine whether devices are performing correctly, whether they are available, or if there are any faults in the network"
This helps troubleshoot and pinpoint problems or discover weak points that might be vulnerable to attacks
NPM can also scale to much larger environments and enterprises
I also find it to be intuitive for beginner users—figuring out how to use NPM isn’t difficult
"This tool is more focused on managing and discovering devices based on IP information, even across subnets"
"In terms of tracking performance and traffic, NPM is the more robust tool, but it’s also useful to be able to manage your IP addresses, especially on a large network"
"If you’re looking for this kind of network scanning, I’d give IPAM a shot"
"In particular, it looks at issues such as weak passwords, misconfigured systems, old software, and exposed services and functions"
It also allows you to scan your entire network over different local environments and create a map of your network
"You can then prioritize, organize, or remedy vulnerabilities"
"Similarly, if you’re looking for effective packet sniffing, Swascan Network Scan tool is also useful"
"First, the interface is engaging, clean, and very simple to use"
"With high-quality data analysis and graphs, Network Scan tool provides complex information about vulnerabilities in your network"
The reports and accompanying managers can then assist you with fixing these errors through their detailed action plan
"Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a service that provides cloud computing, including computing services, storage and databases, networking, analytics, application services, IT management, deployment and developer tools, and mobile and IoT tools"
"The breadth of AWS is so wide, it’s been rapidly adopted in many enterprises"
"Cloud computing is the driving force behind many successful services, because it offers businesses computing resources at scale"
"Database management can be an expensive and complicated operation, and many agile-minded teams aren’t satisfied with the slow progress of database development"
That’s where cloud database management comes in
This guide outlines the basics of cloud database management and reveals how a cloud database management tool can help you achieve your goals
"While traditional databases store their data in tabular relations, NoSQL databases, also known as non-SQL databases, do not"
NoSQL databases were originally designed for modern web-scale databases but are now in widespread use in big data and real-time web applications
"Commonly used data structures include graph, key-value, wide column, and document stores"
"Just like any other database, PostgreSQL requires management and monitoring to perform as it should"
PostgreSQL Enterprise Manager is a popular PostgreSQL manager that allows you to monitor and manage multiple Postgres clusters from one convenient GUI
"The Postgres Enterprise Manager helps you become more efficient at optimizing database performance and accomplishing routing tasks, including backups and bulk changes"
"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth, and system stability improved immediately"

Kinsta supports collaboration at an enterprise scale

Our MyKinsta dashboard provides a single point of visibility for your organization
Give everyone the access they need to do their job with company-wide and site-specific user roles
Company admins can access everything and company developers can manage all websites
"Site admins can access specific production and staging sites, while site developers have restricted access to specific staging environments"
Give developers access to staging environments so they can work on several or specific sites and push changes live
"Tailor to your existing development workflow with SSH access, and use Git or WP-CLI"
"Whether you want to host your main website and blog with us, just your main site, or a proxied site such as a blog, our engineers can tailor a custom Nginx reverse proxy solution for your enterprise"
Load WordPress from a subdirectory or point a subdirectory of your website to an external server
"We’ll handle the behind the scenes set-up, ensuring you’ve got the infrastructure in place to deliver a smooth experience to every user"
"Reverse proxies can be technically complex to configure and support, and sites that use them typically require more support than standard WordPress installs"
We’ve done this countless times — count on our engineers for proactive help when you need it
"Your WordPress website and data are safe, secure, and recoverable with automatic daily backups, as well as system-generated backups, for all sites on your account"
"Access daily, hourly, manual, system-generated, external, and downloadable backups from your MyKinsta dashboard"
Hourly and six-hourly backups are available as optional add-ons
"Each backup is a complete snapshot of your site’s files, database, redirects, and Nginx configuration at the time the backup was created"
"Automatic, manual, and system-generated backups are available as restore points in your MyKinsta dashboard"
"When you restore a backup, a new backup will be auto-generated reflecting the state of your site just before you restored it — handy if you’d like to undo the restore"
That’s why we’ve built our hosting platform with developers in mind
The market is full of data loss prevention tools and trying to find the right one can be overwhelming
"I’ve spent hours investigating the many software options available, and a few stand out for their comprehensiveness and ease of use"
"While all the tools I’m recommending are paid, some have free trials"
"It collects, centralizes, monitors, and analyzes user activity logs, so you can get visibility into the actions of all the users on your network, with real-time reporting if any of those actions violate your business’s policies"
"While the software comes with built-in templates for rules and responses to insider threats, it also gives you the opportunity to easily make your own rules for automatic responses to the threats your business is most concerned with"
"USBs are some of the easiest points through which to steal data, because they’re often unmonitored, or at least not heavily monitored"
"With USB Defender, all USBs on your network are not only secured by suspicious activity monitoring, but are also supported by the active-response technology central to SEM"
This is a huge advantage in protecting sensitive data against threats posed by end users
"Access control is an incredibly important part of DLP, since many data breaches are caused by someone with insider access to the system"
It can even track email account information for your key employees to help prevent scams
"If credentials or other key company data does show up on the tool’s radar, Identity Monitor is designed to notify you quickly"
"By choosing Identity Monitor, you get an extra level of protection without having to put manual effort into combing through company data breaches yourself"
"For peace of mind, SolarWinds Identity Monitor is a worthy investment"
"Symantec Data Loss Prevention is enterprise oriented, meaning while it’s scalable to a smaller business, it may be unnecessarily complicated for small business use"
"If you’re looking for DLP software for a large enterprise, however, this tool provides helpful services"
"The tool provides great coverage throughout your business—in the cloud, on mobile devices, and on multiple endpoints, including desktops and servers"
"It comes with a management dashboard, so you can identify apps trying to access secured information and prevent them from doing so"
The dashboard also lets you stop non-compliant data transfers
"Symantec DLP doesn’t offer a free trial version, nor does it include an easy reporting function for audits"
It’s also worth noting some users complain the dashboard is too rigid
"Some users report Endpoint DLP gives excessive false positives, resulting in alerts for non-critical events, and it sends out frequent updates to fix one problem but cause another"
People say the settings are a bit complex and can be confusing if you don’t have experience with similar software
SecureTrust DLP gives attention to analysis
"It monitors all web-based attachments and documents—including emails, social media posts, and blogs—coming into your business, checking for violations of company governance, acceptable-use policies, and compliance"
Attachments in violation are then automatically blocked
Check Point DLP is a great choice for anyone who has little to no understanding of data loss prevention strategy
It’s easy to use and comes with some preconfigured rules
I’d recommend sticking with one of the tools higher up on this list
The biggest point of difference between Check Point’s data loss prevention software and the others I’m highlighting is it puts a premium on educating your employees about the risks of data loss
Check Point’s focus on education aims to teach employees to be more careful with data and to better identify and respond to incidents
"Beyond the education component, Check Point tracks and controls sensitive data across services, including email and web browsing, even when the data is in motion"
The tool is managed across the entire network from a single console
"Comodo MyDLP is an all-in-one tool covering all your sites and endpoints as well as all your data, which is stored on a cloud server"
"For those users with data access, it determines what actions they can conduct with the data"
"It’s user-friendly, and it can either be accessed through the cloud or installed on-premises"
"It also generally doesn’t go into as much depth in its analysis of suspicious behavior and security risks as other tools, which means it’s lacking in terms of incident management if a data breach occurs"
"When combined with other RSA SIEM solutions, NetWitness can be a powerful data loss prevention tool, though not necessarily as robust as others closer to the top of this list"
The software prioritizes threats and provides analysis to help you get to the root of those threats
"Get all the tools you know and need to help control, speed up, and automate your development workflow"
"SSH, SFTP, WP-CLI, Composer, Git, one-click cloning, and staging environments come standard across all hosting plans"
"Redis, and more are available as add-ons"
We don’t lock you into a single WordPress configuration
"Instead, we provide flexibility and support for custom setups like Bedrock and Trellis, making it easier to develop, maintain, and deploy WordPress sites"
"Switch versions for any of your sites in your MyKinsta dashboard, and have the freedom to run what your third-party plugins need to operate efficiently"
"When making the leap from offering a Saas product to adding an SEO component, we knew we could trust Kinsta with our blogs"
"Using Kinsta's installs and features, our SEO channel (blogs via Kinsta) are now among the top producers of all our sales"
Extend your hosting plan with powerful tools and expert services
"A popular choice for caching database queries, delivering sub-millisecond response times enabling millions of requests per second"
The result: a faster site that uses fewer database resources
Load WordPress from a subdirectory while a separate website (WordPress or otherwise) loads at the root domain
For dynamic sites with large numbers of media files
Increase your plan’s disk space with a monthly add-on

"Purchasing the tool gives you access to webinars, and you’ll need to be willing to devote a good amount of time to those webinars to get a solid grasp of the software"
"DLP tools also help ensure those authorized users aren’t putting the data at risk, whether intentionally or unintentionally"
"DLP solutions do this either through identifying violations of the predefined policy packs included in the software, or by identifying violations of access policies set by the organization"
"They’re especially beneficial given the increases in the intensity of state privacy laws focused on increased data protection and access control in response to the ever-present threat of hackers, who can use the data they steal for financial fraud and identity theft"
DLP software usually includes reporting functions to help you meet auditing and compliance requirements and make sure you don’t incur fines for failing to protect your customers’ data sufficiently
Your customers’ sensitive information is your business’s most valuable possession
"When they give you their private information, customers are trusting you to take every measure possible to protect it"
"Without sensitive data loss prevention tools, you run a serious risk of losing customer data, leading to potential identity theft, financial fraud, and, most importantly, loss of trust"
"No matter the size of a business, the impact of data breaches can be devastating, causing both financial losses and losses to reputation, and could cause the business to fail"
"Often, the hackers don’t even have to work hard to achieve their goals"
"In the Facebook example, the hackers simply discovered an unprotected server and were then able to access all the data it contained"
"While Facebook is a large enough institution to recover from a breach of this magnitude, most businesses aren’t as integral a part of society as Facebook is today—which means it’s much easier for customers to take their business elsewhere if they become concerned about the security of their information"
"Intellectual property loss and data breaches can be the result of some action taken by an insider, whether intentional (like a disgruntled former employee putting sensitive information onto an external hard drive to sell to a competitor) or unintentional (as when an employee finds a flash drive and plugs it into their computer to find out what’s on it)"
"For this reason, one of the core components of data loss protection is managing access control, which means monitoring and controlling who have sensitive data access and what they can do with it"
Rather than try to manually monitor user activity on your own—an endeavor likely to become overwhelming—I advise implementing a data loss prevention tool engaged in access control
"Managing access control involves monitoring the behaviors of users on the network, including what data they are accessing"
"As a result, when there’s a data breach, administrators have a record of information they can consult to quickly pinpoint where the attack occurred and what users or devices were involved"
"In short, the ability to respond to an attack quickly is critical to preventing data loss"
Logs are one of the most important assets for an IT administrator when trying to discover the cause of a problem in the network or on a device
"When it comes to data loss prevention, user activity logs continue to be a crucial asset"
"Through comprehensive monitoring tracking every event on the devices across your network, you’re taking one of the strongest steps possible to protect your data"
"When making a data loss prevention solution comparison, take time to think through which features will be most valuable based on the needs of your business and what you consider to be the main threats to the security of your data"
"Although all the tools on this list seek to protect your sensitive information, their focus and strengths vary"
While different DLP devices approach their monitoring and analysis in different ways
"Equipped with this type of analysis, you can make sure any users who have access to your sensitive data absolutely require it—an essential step, since every point of access is an opportunity for a data breach"
"Speee began operating an internally developed CMS, but they encountered problems in three areas: cost, usability, and stability"
"With the combination of WordPress and Kinsta, their workflow became incredibly smooth, and system stability improved immediately"
"As “WordPress guardians”, Motto’s high-value plans and products include development, hosting, domains, branding, and site speed"
Motto’s clients are able to focus on other elements of their business knowing their sites are left in good hands
"Check out our interview below with Motto CEO Julian Fernandez, CTO Greg Hunt, and Senior Developer Quentin Petitjean to learn more about their experience with Kinsta"
Motto needed a WordPress host whose service aligned with the level of reliability and speed Motto wanted to provide their customers
"In order to provide their clients with the full WordPress experience, Motto needed a reliable host that was as serious about speed and support as they were"
"Before discovering Kinsta, Motto tested a few different hosting options, all of which fell flat, especially when it came to support"
"However, we came to find out there was nothing special at all about their WordPress hosting besides the fact that it could run WordPress on a LAMP stack"
"Their support also never had good resolutions, always needed to be escalated, and was slow"
We then rolled our own on DigitalOcean
"While we had much more control, this led to higher administrative and opportunity costs just to keep it running properly"
We then started building our own tools but this was time away from the business
"Trusting their clients’ sites to Kinsta gave Motto peace of mind, impressed their clients, sped up the sites they manage, and helped them save money"
"Motto was able to eliminate all of the extra costs associated with the hosting management of their WordPress sites, including the retainer for our system’s administrator"
"Most issues brought to Kinsta support are resolved in hours, not days, and Motto is able to get to the bottom of a lot more of them"

Not all hosting plans are made equal
"If you’re not hosting with Kinsta, you’re losing money"
Here’s the proof of our cost-to-benefit ratio
Your WordPress site’s performance impacts your SEO and conversion rates
"If your host isn’t providing the best infrastructure around, there’s a good chance you’re losing out to your competitors"
"Website issues happen, but the way your host helps you troubleshoot them makes all the difference"
"If immediate, expert support isn’t included in your plan, there’s a good chance you’ll be paying for it, one way or another"
"If you’ve ever hosted your WordPress site with big shared hosts, you know that performance is not their strongest skill"
The cheap pricing is not worth the crammed servers and super slow load times
"At Kinsta, we’re constantly striving to provide the fastest experience possible"
Our customers know their SEO and conversion rates aren’t likely to be impacted by hosting
"GCP’s premium tier delivers traffic over Google’s well-provisioned, low latency, global network (ie, the cables at the bottom of the ocean)"
"Packets spend more time on Google’s network, minimizing distance and hops, and resulting in the fast and secure transport of your data"
There are other hosts who don’t disclose which GCP network they use
Google’s standard tier is comparable to other major public clouds
"Instead of sticking to Google’s network, it delivers outbound traffic to the ISP networks, in turn slowing down your site and lowering conversions"
"The closer your website to your visitors, the lower your latency and the faster your load times"
We use Google Cloud Platform’s multi-regional deployment mode so you can choose between different Google Cloud data center locations for each of your WordPress websites
Easily select your data center of choice from your MyKinsta dashboard
Cloudflare is one of the top players in web security and performance
"At Kinsta, we pay for Cloudflare’s premium offering for you so that you can enjoy these features for free"
"Malicious traffic can hurt your website, reputation, and bottom line"
"Overall, this means we’ll be able to provide better protection for your WordPress site"
DDoS attacks almost always result in a crashed site
They work by flooding sites with large amounts of traffic in a short period of time with the goal of crippling server resources
Millions of websites fall prey to these attacks every year
"Not only does reviving a crashed site take resources, but it can also have a huge impact on revenue"
"The closer your content to your website visitors, the faster your site"

It’ll save you headaches and all sorts of issues and your clients will be super happy so it’s a no brainer

"Our engineering team had strict requirements for stability, speed, and maintainability"

"From migration to blazing fast WordPress hosting, moving our nonprofit organization’s site to Kinsta was the best decision since establishing our online presence"
We had been with another hosting company for several years
Their customer service was always challenging
"Two months ago, our site was hacked"
"Ever since then, we struggled to get it fixed"
"The hosting company not only doubled our monthly fees, but failed repeatedly to get the situation under control"
They left us with a broken WordPress site that they couldn’t fix
We lost revenues and site visits
"Finally, someone recommended we try Kinsta"
We are so thrilled to finally have a true hosting partner that understands and knows how to help us
We are planning a lot of growth in the next year and are grateful to have found a hosting partner we feel confident will help us succeed
