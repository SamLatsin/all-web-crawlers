So, this morning I check the account and it\u2019s blown down to $8. He put on 4 AAPL trades at $50 and they all lost.

If you come in to make 1000% then broker will most likely will be manipulating against you. Youtube traders are affiliates so of course nothing will go wrong for them with their amazing flipping strategies. Think of a plan and just trade accordingly to your strategy and have money management. Make sure you withdraw percentage weekly. Better to steal from them slowly than them stealing you fully in a short period time. My experience long story short. You should Make only 2 max deposits and no more or they will steal from you. Literally different wallet addresses everytime you deposit and it can easily be manipulated and stolen. I always triple check my wallet address before sending and my 200 deposit Pending now is expired. Stolen. Support will not answer unless you are a master trader which is a 10,000$ -50000$ deposit unless you make it that far trading from a low balance which makes absolutely no sense. Still my account manager hasn\u2019t even answered me yet. Probably enjoying my 800$ out at a restaurant being proud to scam people. It\u2019ll be legit until you\u2019re making massive profit. Don\u2019t grab their attention by making 100% and invest slowly. From the review of people getting their money back with little profits and from people having trouble with withdrawing massive amount of money. No support to help and a little bad comment will get your account close. I would get back in since I\u2019ve made a plan but of course my money is stolen so I\u2019m out. Good luck to all.
